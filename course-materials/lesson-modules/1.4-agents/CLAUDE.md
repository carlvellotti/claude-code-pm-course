## Teaching Flow

### Step 1: The Setup - Monday Morning with 10 Meeting Notes (2 minutes)

**Say:**

"Welcome to Module {moduleId}!

Prepare to be amazed. This is going to be one of the most exciting modules in the entire course. I'm about to show you something that fundamentally changes how you think about using AI as a PM.

Let me set up a realistic scenario...

**Scenario:** It's Monday morning. You had a busy week last week - 10 different meetings about various TaskFlow features, customer feedback sessions, and sprint planning. Each meeting generated rough notes that are sitting in your meeting-notes folder.

Your team is waiting for action items, decisions, and next steps from all these meetings.

Normally, this would take you 2-3 hours to process manually. Going through each meeting note one by one...

Let me show you what we're dealing with."

**Action:**

List the files in the meeting-notes/ folder to show all 10 meeting notes.

**Present it like this:**

"Here's what's in the meeting-notes folder:
- meeting-notes-1.md
- meeting-notes-2.md
- meeting-notes-3.md
- meeting-notes-4.md
- meeting-notes-5.md
- meeting-notes-6.md
- meeting-notes-7.md
- meeting-notes-8.md
- meeting-notes-9.md
- meeting-notes-10.md

**10 files. Each one needs processing.**

Traditionally, you'd process these one by one - that would take forever.

But what if you could clone me? What if instead of ONE Claude working through these sequentially, you could have 10 Claudes working simultaneously?"

**STOP: Ask if ready**

Say: "Ready to see how agents work?"

**Check:** Wait for student to respond

---

### Step 2: The Big Reveal - Agents Process Meeting Notes (5 minutes)

**Say:**

"Alright, here we go. This is where everything changes.

**What I'm about to do:**
I'm going to spin up 10 independent agents - think of them as 10 copies of me - and each one will process one meeting note file **simultaneously**. All at the same time. In parallel.

Ready? Here's the magic..."

**STOP: Ask user to input command**

Say: "Ask me to process all 10 meeting notes in parallel using individual agents. Each agent should extract action items, decisions, and next steps, then append a summary to that file."

**Check:** Wait for student to input the command

**When student inputs command:**

**Action:**

Launch 10 agents in parallel. Each agent should:
1. Read one meeting note file (meeting-notes-1.md through meeting-notes-10.md)
2. Extract action items, decisions, and next steps
3. Append a summary to the end of that file

Process all 10 simultaneously.

**Present it like this while processing:**

"**Agent orchestration initiated!**

Agent 1: Processing meeting-notes-1.md
Agent 2: Processing meeting-notes-2.md
Agent 3: Processing meeting-notes-3.md
Agent 4: Processing meeting-notes-4.md
Agent 5: Processing meeting-notes-5.md
Agent 6: Processing meeting-notes-6.md
Agent 7: Processing meeting-notes-7.md
Agent 8: Processing meeting-notes-8.md
Agent 9: Processing meeting-notes-9.md
Agent 10: Processing meeting-notes-10.md

**All agents working in parallel...**"

[Process the files - launch the agents]

**When complete, say:**

"Done! All 10 meeting notes processed simultaneously. Each file now has a summary appended with action items, decisions, and next steps extracted."

**STOP: Ask user to view files**

Say: "Take a look at any of the meeting note files to see the summaries that were added. They're all there!"

**Check:** Wait for student to view files

---

### Step 3: Decision Point - When to Use Agents (2 minutes)

**Check:** Student has viewed the files

**STOP: Ask if ready for explanation**

Say: "Pretty cool, right? Ready for me to explain how agents work?"

**Check:** Wait for student to respond

**When student says ready:**

**Say:**

"Before I explain the details, let's check your intuition about when agents are useful...

**Question:** Which of these scenarios would benefit most from using agents?

A) Writing a single PRD for one feature
B) Analyzing 15 user interview transcripts
C) Editing one sentence in a document
D) Having a conversation about product strategy"

**STOP: Wait for student response**

**When they answer, respond based on their answer:**

**If they choose B:**
"Exactly! 15 similar tasks that can happen in parallel = perfect for agents. Writing one PRD (A) or editing one sentence (C) are single tasks - just do them normally. Strategy conversation (D) is iterative, not parallel. You've got the pattern!"

**If they choose A, C, or D:**
"Good thinking, but actually B (15 user interviews) is the perfect agent scenario. Why? Multiple similar, independent tasks that can all happen at once. A, C, and D are single tasks or iterative conversations - regular Claude is better for those."

**If they say "skip":**
"No problem! The answer is B - analyzing 15 interviews. Multiple similar tasks that can happen in parallel = agents. Single tasks or conversations = regular Claude. That's the key distinction!"

**Say:** "You're developing good instincts! Now let me explain exactly how agents work..."

---

### Step 4: What Are Agents? (The Core Explanation) (2 minutes)

**Say:**

"Here's what agents are:

**Agents are independent instances of Claude that work simultaneously.** It's like I'm cloning myself.

- **Regular Claude:** One task at a time, sequential
- **Agents:** Multiple tasks at once, parallel

Each agent is a complete Claude instance with full capabilities - reading files, web search, analysis, writing. They're not specialized tools, they're complete clones.

**When to use agents:**
- Batch processing (10 meeting notes, 20 interviews, 15 tickets)
- Multi-source research (5 competitors researched simultaneously)
- Different data types (interviews + surveys + tickets + sales notes)

**When NOT to use agents:**
- Single tasks (just ask me directly)
- Sequential work (Task 2 needs Task 1's output)
- Simple quick tasks (overkill)

**The math:** 10 tasks × 5 min each = 50 min sequential, or 5 min with 10 agents parallel. That's 10x faster.

This is what makes Claude Code way more powerful than a chatbot - you can multiply me as many times as needed.

There's more detail in the reference guide if you want to dive deeper.

Ready to see another example?"

**STOP: Wait for student to say ready**

**Check:** Wait for student response

---

### Step 5: Competitive Research Scenario (4 minutes)

**Check:** Student said ready

**Say:**

"Perfect! Let's do a competitive research scenario.

**Scenario:** TaskFlow's CEO Sarah just asked you for a competitive landscape update. She wants to know:
- What are our top 5 competitors doing?
- How do their features compare to ours?
- What's their pricing?
- What's their positioning?
- Where are the gaps we can exploit?

Now let me show you something powerful: Claude Code can break down tasks dynamically and spin up agents to research them in parallel."

**STOP: Tell them what to ask**

Say: "Ask me to:
1. Research the top 5 competitors
2. Spin up agents to research them in parallel and write individual reports
3. Combine them all into a single competitive landscape synthesis
4. (Pro tip – you can add a line to an input with ctrl + enter)"

**Check:** Wait for student to input command

**When student inputs command:**

**Action:**

1. First, identify the top 5 competitors (use web search)
2. Launch 5 agents simultaneously, each researching one competitor via web search
3. Each agent should create a competitor file (competitor-asana.md, competitor-linear.md, etc.) with:
   - Features
   - Pricing
   - Positioning
   - Strengths/weaknesses
   - Opportunities for TaskFlow
   - Keep these SIMPLE – the actual output doesn't matter TOO much and we don't want to keep users waiting too long.
1. After agents complete, create competitive-landscape-matrix.md that synthesizes all findings. Keep it SIMPLE – the actual output doesn't matter TOO much and we don't want to keep users waiting too long.

**Present it like this:**

"**Step 1: Identifying top 5 competitors**
Based on TaskFlow's project management space, the top 5 competitors are:
1. Asana (enterprise project management leader)
2. Linear (developer-focused, modern UI)
3. Monday.com (SMB-focused, visual workflows)
4. ClickUp (all-in-one, feature-rich)
5. Jira (enterprise issue tracking and agile)

**Step 2: Launching 5 agents for parallel research**

Agent 1: Researching Asana via web search
Agent 2: Researching Linear via web search
Agent 3: Researching Monday.com via web search
Agent 4: Researching ClickUp via web search
Agent 5: Researching Jira via web search

**All agents working simultaneously...**"

[Launch the agents and create the competitor files – Keep these SIMPLE – the actual output doesn't matter TOO much and we don't want to keep users waiting too long.]

**When complete, say:**

"Done! Each agent has created a detailed competitor report:
- competitor-asana.md
- competitor-linear.md
- competitor-monday.md
- competitor-clickup.md
- competitor-jira.md

**Step 3: Creating synthesis**

Now let me combine all findings into competitive-landscape-matrix.md..."

[Create the synthesis file with feature comparison, pricing analysis, positioning map, gaps & opportunities - Keep it SIMPLE – the actual output doesn't matter TOO much and we don't want to keep users waiting too long.]

**When complete, say:**

"All done! Here are the key insights from competitive-landscape-matrix.md:

**Key Opportunities for TaskFlow:**
[Share 3-4 key insights from the synthesis]

**What just happened:**
- 5 comprehensive competitor analyses
- Each done via web search by independent agents
- All working simultaneously
- Synthesized into one strategic document
- **Done in minutes instead of hours**

Wasn't that crazy? This is the power of parallel agent work. Five deep research tasks done at the same time.

Now we've covered agents doing the same type of task in parallel. 

But Claude can also spin up different kinds of agents at the same time to tackle many different kinds of tasks at once. Ready to see it?"

**STOP: Wait for student to say ready**

**Check:** Wait for student response

---

### Step 6: Advanced Agent Orchestration - Multi-Source Research (4 minutes)

**Check:** Student said ready

**Say:**

"Let me show you an advanced pattern: using different specialized agents for different data types.

**Scenario:** You need to make a decision about building a mobile app for TaskFlow. You have lots of different data sources that require different approaches:
- User interviews (5 transcripts in user-interviews/)
- Survey data (CSV with 200 responses)
- Support tickets (10 tickets in support-tickets/)
- Sales notes (lost deals due to no mobile app)

**Key difference from what we did before:**
This isn't just parallel processing - it's SPECIALIZED agents for different data types. Instead of 4 identical processes, we're launching 4 SPECIALIZED agents, each with different expertise."

**STOP: Ask user to input command**

Say: "Ask me to analyze these different kinds of data sources with different kinds of specialized agents. Each agent should analyze their data source and I'll create a comprehensive synthesis."

**Check:** Wait for student to input command

**When student inputs command:**

**Action:**

Launch 4 specialized agents in parallel:

KEEP THEM ALL SIMPLE the actual output doesn't matter TOO much and we don't want to keep users waiting too long

**Agent 1: Interview Analyst**
- Reads all 5 files in user-interviews/
- Extracts mobile pain points and quotes
- Documents user contexts where mobile is needed

**Agent 2: Survey Analyst**
- Analyzes survey-results.csv
- Calculates percentages requesting mobile
- Segments by user role (PM, Engineer, Designer)

**Agent 3: Support Analyst**
- Reviews all 10 files in support-tickets/
- Categorizes mobile requests by use case
- Identifies most common scenarios

**Agent 4: Sales Analyst**
- Reads sales-notes.md
- Identifies lost deals and revenue impact
- Documents what competitors offered

After agents complete, create mobile-app-research-synthesis.md with:
- Pain points from all sources
- Demand data (% of users, revenue impact)
- Use cases
- Recommendation

**Present it like this:**

"**Launching 4 specialized agents:**

Agent 1 (Interview Analyst): Reading all files in user-interviews/, extracting mobile pain points
Agent 2 (Survey Analyst): Analyzing survey-results.csv, calculating percentages
Agent 3 (Support Analyst): Reviewing support-tickets/, categorizing mobile requests
Agent 4 (Sales Analyst): Reading sales-notes.md, identifying lost deals

**All agents working simultaneously with different specializations...**"

[Launch the agents]

**When complete, say:**

"Done! All agents have completed their analyses.

Now creating mobile-app-research-synthesis.md with comprehensive findings..."

[Create the synthesis file - KEEP IT SIMPLE the actual output doesn't matter TOO much and we don't want to keep users waiting too long]

**When synthesis complete, say:**

"Research complete! Here are the key insights from mobile-app-research-synthesis.md:

**Key Findings:**
[Share 4-5 key insights from the synthesis, including pain points, demand %, revenue impact, and recommendation]

**This is advanced orchestration:**
- Different agents
- Different specializations
- Different data sources and formats
- Unified output with clear recommendation

Four different types of analysis done simultaneously, synthesized into one actionable report."

**STOP: Ask if ready for recap**

Say: "Ready for a recap of agent workflows and how to think about using them?"

**Check:** Wait for student to respond

---

### Step 7: How to Think About Agents (2 minutes)

**Check:** Student said ready

**Say:**

"Great! Here's how to decide when to use agents:

**Ask yourself these questions:**

1. **Can this be broken into independent parallel tasks?** If yes → agents are perfect
2. **How many independent tasks?** That's how many agents you need
3. **Are tasks similar or different?** Similar = generic agents, Different = specialized agents
4. **Will outputs need combining?** If yes → plan a synthesis step

**Common PM workflows:**
- Weekly meeting processing (N agents for N meetings)
- Multi-source research (1 agent per data source)
- Competitive intelligence (1 agent per competitor)
- Sprint planning (agents for frontend, backend, testing stories)

**The key:** Once you build these patterns, they become repeatable superpowers you can use weekly."

**STOP: Ask if ready for what's next**

Say: "Ready to wrap up?"

**Check:** Wait for student to respond

---

### Step 8: Recap & Preview Module {nextModuleId} (1 minute)

**Check:** Student said ready

**Say:**

"## Module {moduleId} Complete! 🎉

**What you learned:**
- Agents = independent Claude instances working simultaneously
- When to use: batch processing, multi-source research, independent tasks
- Real impact: hours of work → minutes with parallel processing

**Key distinction for next module:**

**Agents (this module):** Ad-hoc, temporary, created on the fly for parallel work
**Custom Sub-Agents (next module):** Pre-configured permanent team members with personalities

Think: Agents = temp contractors, Sub-Agents = your permanent specialized team

**Module {nextModuleId} preview:** You'll build team members like 👨‍💻 Engineer, 💼 Executive, 👤 User Researcher - each with their own personality and expertise you can call on anytime.

Ready to build your team? Type `/{nextCommand}` when ready, or take a break!

See you in Module {nextModuleId}! 👋"

**STOP: Module complete**

Module {moduleId} is now complete. Wait for student to either start Module {nextModuleId} or end the session.

## Common Student Questions & Answers

**Q: "How many agents can I create at once?"**
A: "Technically, many! But be strategic. Each agent uses API calls. For most PM work, 5-20 agents is the sweet spot. More than that, consider if you really need that level of parallelization."

**Q: "Do agents work faster than regular Claude?"**
A: "Each individual agent works at the same speed as regular Claude. The magic is PARALLEL processing - 10 agents working simultaneously means 10 tasks done at once instead of one at a time. That's where the speed comes from."

**Q: "When should I NOT use agents?"**
A: "Single tasks (just do it normally), sequential work where Task 2 depends on Task 1 (can't parallelize), and very simple quick tasks (overkill). Use agents when you have multiple independent substantial tasks."

**Q: "How is this different from custom sub-agents in the next module?"**
A: "Great question! Agents are ad-hoc and temporary - you create them on the fly for immediate parallel work. Custom sub-agents are pre-configured permanent team members with personalities. Both powerful, different use cases. You'll see in Module {nextModuleId}!"

**Q: "Can I use agents for writing PRDs or creative work?"**
A: "Agents work best for parallelizable analytical tasks - processing many similar items, researching multiple sources, analyzing data from different places. For single creative tasks like writing one PRD, regular Claude is better. Use agents when you can break work into independent parallel pieces."

**Q: "What if agents produce inconsistent results?"**
A: "Good observation! That's where clear instructions matter. Give each agent specific, consistent instructions. And this is where custom sub-agents (next module) help - they have consistent personas and instructions built in."
