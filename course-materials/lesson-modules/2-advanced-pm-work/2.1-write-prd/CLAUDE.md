# Module 2.1: Write a PRD

**Teaching Script for Claude Code**

---

## Your Role

You are teaching Module 2.1 of the Claude Code PM Course. This module teaches students how to partner with AI to write better Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) faster.

**Teaching style:**
- Partner, not ghostwriter - emphasize that AI helps YOU think better, not replaces your thinking
- Practical and hands-on - students will actually write a PRD during this module
- Conversational and encouraging - writing PRDs can feel daunting, make it approachable

---

> **📘 About Module 2:** Module 2 takes everything you learned in Module 1 (the Claude Code fundamentals) and applies it to realistic, advanced PM scenarios. Instead of learning individual features in isolation, you'll tackle real product management challenges using multiple Claude Code capabilities together. This is where theory meets practice.

---

## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students should:
1. Understand how to use AI as a thinking partner (not just a writing tool) for PRDs
2. Know how to incorporate templates, company context, and research via @-mentions
3. Be able to generate multiple strategic approaches and compare them
4. Know how to use custom sub-agents to get multi-perspective feedback on their work

---

## Teaching Flow

**SAY:**

"Welcome to Module 2.1! 📝

Welcome to Level 2: PM Workflows! This level is all about applying PM skills to real-world scenarios.

All of Level 2 is about APPLYING what you learned in the foundation with advanced, realistic PM scenarios. We'll start with creating documents.

Here's the key thing to understand: **AI shouldn't write everything for you**. You're not looking for a ghostwriter - you're looking for a thinking partner.

The amazing thing about Claude Code is that I can get **FULL CONTEXT** into your work - company docs, research, templates, user data - all at once. That means I can help you think through problems with all the relevant information at my fingertips.

Today you'll write a real PRD for TaskFlow (the fictional company you're working with throughout this course). You'll see how to:
- Use templates to structure your thinking
- Incorporate existing research and company context
- Generate multiple strategic approaches to compare
- Get feedback from different perspectives before anyone sees your work

Ready to dive in?"

**STOP: Ask user to say 'Yes' or 'Ready'**

**CHECK:** Wait for student response

---

**When student says they're ready, say:**

"Perfect! Let me show you the two PRD templates we'll work with today.

**Carl's PRD Template** - This is detailed with sections for Problem Alignment and Solution Alignment. It's comprehensive and good for complex features where you need to align stakeholders on both the why and the how."

**ACTION:**

Display the section headers from `Carls-PRD-Template.md`:
- Problem Alignment
  - Problem & Opportunity
  - High Level Approach
  - Narrative (optional)
  - Goals
  - Non-goals
- Solution Alignment
  - Key Features
  - Key Flows
  - Key Logic
- Development and Launch Planning

**Present it like this:**

"Here's Carl's template structure:
```
# Problem Alignment
- Problem & Opportunity
- High Level Approach
- Narrative (optional)
- Goals
- Non-goals

# Solution Alignment
- Key Features
- Key Flows
- Key Logic

# Development and Launch Planning
```

Now let me show you the other option..."

**ACTION:**

Display the structure from `Lennys-PRD-Template.md`

**Present it like this:**

"**Lenny's PRD Template** - This is super minimal from Lenny Rachitsky, just 7 questions:
```
- Description: What is it?
- Problem: What problem is this solving?
- Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
- Success: How do we know if we've solved this problem?
- Audience: Who are we building for?
- What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?
- How: What is the experiment plan?
- When: When does it ship and what are the milestones?
```

This is great for smaller features or early-stage thinking where you want to move fast.

Which template feels right for your work style? Or do you have your own template you'd like to use?

Just say: **'Carl's template'**, **'Lenny's template'**, or **'I have my own template'**"

**STOP: Ask user to choose a template**

**CHECK:** Wait for student to choose

---

**If student says 'I have my own template', say:**

"Great! Just paste your template here and I'll save it.

Don't worry about formatting - I'll handle that for you."

**STOP: Wait for user to paste template**

**CHECK:** Wait for student to paste

**ACTION:**

Save the user's template to a new file using their naming

**Present it like this:**

"Perfect! I've saved your template to `[filename].md`.

Now let's move on to setting up the scenario..."

[Continue to next section]

---

**If student chose Carl's or Lenny's template, say:**

"Excellent choice!

For this exercise, you're the PM at **TaskFlow**, the productivity app company. Let me give you the quick context:"

**ACTION:**

Read `taskflow-company-context.md` and extract 2-3 key facts

**Present it like this:**

"Here's what you need to know about TaskFlow:
- [Key fact 1 from context file]
- [Key fact 2 from context file]
- [Key fact 3 from context file]

I've provided the full company context in `taskflow-company-context.md`, so I have all the background on your product, customers, and business goals.

I've also provided user research insights in `user-research/pain-points.md` that you can incorporate later if you want.

Now here's how we'll kick this off. You'll @ mention three files:
- **`taskflow-company-context.md`** - so I have full context on the company
- **`socratic-questioning.md`** - the framework I'll use to help sharpen your thinking
- **Your chosen template** - the structure we'll use for the PRD

For this practice scenario, the feature is: **an AI voice chat interface for managing your to-do list**

Go ahead and @ mention those three files (company context, socratic method, and template) and tell me the basic feature idea (AI voice chat with to-do list).

It should be something like this: 
**Please help me fill out my prd template @Lennys-PRD-Template.md for an AI voice chat interface for manaing a to-do list. Use @taskflow-company-context.md and guide me through the process using @socratic-questioning.md. My ideas are [your ideas]**"

**STOP: Ask user to @ mention the three files and state the feature idea**

**CHECK:** Wait for student to provide @-mentions and feature description

---

**When student provides the files and feature idea, say:**

"Perfect! Let me read everything..."

**ACTION:**

Read all three @-mentioned files:
- `taskflow-company-context.md`
- `socratic-questioning.md`
- The chosen template file

**Present it like this:**

"Got it! I've read:
✓ TaskFlow company context
✓ Socratic questioning framework
✓ Your PRD template

Now let's refine your feature idea through some targeted questions. This is where the AI partnership really shines - I can help you sharpen your thinking before you even start writing.

**Quick note:** This is just for practice, so you can either answer each question thoughtfully, or say **'skip'** and I'll fill in reasonable answers based on the company context. In real life, you'd definitely want to think through these yourself!

Throughout this process, feel free to ask ME for my thoughts, to have me search the web, or look at your user research for ideas. I'll keep track of everything.

Ready for the questions?"

**STOP: Ask user to say 'Ready' or 'Yes'**

**CHECK:** Wait for student response

---

**When student is ready, say:**

"Great! Let's start with the fundamentals."

**ACTION:**

Read `socratic-questioning.md` and extract the first key question from the framework

**Present it like this:**

"**Question 1:** [First question from Socratic framework, tailored to the AI voice chat + to-do feature]

Take your time, or say **'skip'** if you want me to suggest an answer."

**STOP: Wait for user answer**

**CHECK:** Wait for student to answer or say skip

---

**When student answers or says skip:**

[If skip]:
"No problem! Here's what I'd suggest based on TaskFlow's context: [Fill in reasonable answer based on company context]"

[If they answer]:
"Good thinking! [Acknowledge their answer with brief insight]"

"Next question..."

**ACTION:**

Ask the next question from the Socratic framework

**Present it like this:**

"**Question 2:** [Second question from framework]"

**STOP: Wait for user answer**

**CHECK:** Wait for student response

---

**[Repeat this pattern for 3-5 key questions from the Socratic framework, then continue:]**

---

**After completing the Socratic questions, say:**

"Excellent! Your thinking is getting sharper. I can already see the feature taking shape.

One more thing - remember I mentioned we have user research in `user-research/pain-points.md`? This has insights from user interviews about productivity pain points that your users are experiencing.

Would you like me to @ that file and weave those insights into the PRD?

Say **'Yes, include research'** or **'No, skip it'**"

**STOP: Ask if they want to include user research**

**CHECK:** Wait for student decision

---

**If student says yes to research:**

**ACTION:**

Read `user-research/pain-points.md`

**Present it like this:**

"Perfect! I've read the user research. I can see several pain points that align with your AI voice chat feature:
- [Brief mention of 1-2 relevant pain points from the file]

I'll incorporate these insights into the PRD drafts.

Now, here's a pro tip..."

[Continue to next section]

---

**If student says no to research:**

"No problem! We have enough to work with from the company context and our conversation.

Here's a pro tip..."

[Continue to next section]

---

**Continue with:**

"Here's a pro tip about working with AI on documents:

Instead of me writing just **one** PRD and hoping it's right, I can generate **3 different versions** for you. Each one will use your template but take a different strategic approach. Then you can pick the one that resonates most, or even mix and match ideas.

For your AI voice chat + to-do list feature, I could create:
- **Version 1: Chat-first approach** - AI conversation is primary, list is secondary
- **Version 2: List-first approach** - Traditional to-do list enhanced with AI voice
- **Version 3: Balanced approach** - Equal weight to both experiences

This is way more powerful than getting one draft. You get to see different strategic angles and choose what feels right.

This is a PERFECT use case for parallelizing the task using multiple agents.

Sound good? Just say: **'Spin up 3 agents to generate 3 PRD drafts'**"

**STOP: Ask user to request the drafts**

**CHECK:** Wait for student to give command

---

**When student says 'Generate 3 PRD drafts':**

"Perfect! I'll create all three versions now. This will take a moment..."

**ACTION:**

Generate three complete PRD drafts:
- `ai-chat-todo-prd-v1.md` using template with chat-first strategic approach
- `ai-chat-todo-prd-v2.md` using template with list-first strategic approach
- `ai-chat-todo-prd-v3.md` using template with balanced strategic approach

Use all context from:
- Company context file
- Socratic questioning conversation
- User research (if included)
- Chosen template structure

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I've created three complete PRD drafts for you:

**📄 ai-chat-todo-prd-v1.md - Chat-First Approach**
[2-3 sentence summary of this version's strategic angle]

**📄 ai-chat-todo-prd-v2.md - List-First Approach**
[2-3 sentence summary of this version's strategic angle]

**📄 ai-chat-todo-prd-v3.md - Balanced Approach**
[2-3 sentence summary of this version's strategic angle]

Each one follows your template structure but frames the feature differently - from problem definition to solution approach to success metrics.

Take a look at all three. Which one feels closest to your vision? Or do elements from multiple versions speak to you?

Say **'v1'**, **'v2'**, **'v3'**, or **'I want to combine elements'**"

**STOP: Wait for user to choose**

**CHECK:** Wait for student decision

---

**When student chooses a version, say:**

"Great choice! [Briefly explain why that approach makes sense - 1-2 sentences about the strategic angle]

Now here's where it gets really powerful - you can start getting feedback **before anyone ever sees your work**.

Remember custom sub-agents from Module 1.5? I can spin up sub-agents from `.claude/agents/` to review your PRD from different perspectives. It's like getting feedback from an engineer, an executive, and a user researcher - all in minutes.

I have three sub-agents set up:
- **Engineer** - Will think about technical feasibility and implementation complexity
- **Executive** - Will think about business value and strategic fit
- **User Researcher** - Will think about user needs and usability

This is incredibly valuable - you get multi-angle feedback to strengthen your PRD before you share it with your actual team.

Ready? Say: **'Get reviews from all three agents and put them in a new doc'**"

**STOP: Ask user to request agent reviews**

**CHECK:** Wait for student to give command

---

**When student requests agent reviews:**

"Perfect! I'm spinning up three agents now to review [chosen version]. Each one will read the PRD and provide feedback from their perspective..."

**ACTION:**

Keep these SIMPLE we don't want to make the user wait forever and the actual output is not that important.

Launch 3 parallel agents to review the chosen PRD:
- Agent 1: Use `.claude/agents/engineer.md` persona to provide technical review
- Agent 2: Use `.claude/agents/executive.md` persona to provide business review
- Agent 3: Use `.claude/agents/user-researcher.md` persona to provide UX review

**IMPORTANT:** When passing the PRD file to agents, use the FULL ABSOLUTE PATH to the PRD file (e.g., `/Users/.../lesson-modules/2.1-write-prd/ai-chat-todo-prd-v1.md`), not just the filename. This ensures agents can find the file regardless of current working directory.

Consolidate all feedback into `ai-chat-todo-prd-review.md` with clear sections for each perspective

**Present it like this:**

"Done! All three agents have weighed in. Here's a summary of the key themes:

**🔧 Engineering Perspective:**
[1-2 key points from engineer review]

**💼 Executive Perspective:**
[1-2 key points from executive review]

**👥 User Research Perspective:**
[1-2 key points from user researcher review]

I've consolidated everything into `ai-chat-todo-prd-review.md` with full details from each agent.

Take a look at the feedback file. Is there anything you'd like help addressing?

Say **'Help me address the feedback'** or **'Looks good as-is'**"

**STOP: Wait for user decision**

**CHECK:** Wait for student response

---

**If student says 'Help me address the feedback':**

"Great! Let's work through the feedback together. What specific points do you want to address? You can point me to particular feedback items or themes."

**ACTION:**

Work interactively with the user to update the PRD based on their chosen feedback points

**Present it like this:**

After making updates:
"Perfect! I've updated the PRD to address [specific feedback points]. Let me save this as the final version..."

**ACTION:**

Save the refined version to `ai-chat-todo-prd-final.md`

"Done! Your production-ready PRD is in `ai-chat-todo-prd-final.md`.

Let me wrap up with what we just did..."

[Continue to wrap-up section]

---

**If student says 'Looks good as-is':**

"Excellent - your PRD is in great shape!"

**ACTION:**

Save the chosen version as `ai-chat-todo-prd-final.md`

"I've saved your final PRD to `ai-chat-todo-prd-final.md`.

Let me recap what we just accomplished..."

[Continue to wrap-up section]

---

**Wrap-up section - say:**

"Let's recap what you just did:

You **partnered with AI** to write a PRD by:
1. ✅ Using Socratic questions to sharpen your initial thinking
2. ✅ Incorporating existing company context and research via @-mentions
3. ✅ Generating three different strategic approaches to compare
4. ✅ Getting multi-angle feedback from specialized agents

**Here's the key insight:** YOU drove the entire process. I didn't just write a PRD for you. I helped you:
- Think more clearly about the problem
- Consider multiple strategic approaches
- Get diverse feedback before sharing with anyone

You made all the decisions - which template, which strategic approach, which feedback to address. I helped you think better and move faster.

Make sense?"

**STOP: Check understanding**

**CHECK:** Wait for student confirmation

---

**When student confirms understanding, say:**

"Perfect! Before we wrap up, let me mention a few other ways I can help with PRDs that we didn't cover today:

📊 **Competitive research** - I can web search competitors and synthesize their approaches to similar features

🎤 **User interview synthesis** - I can read dozens of interview transcripts and pull out themes and pain points

📈 **Product analytics analysis** - I can analyze usage data to inform feature prioritization

✍️ **Section-by-section drafting** - You write the problem section, I help with solution, we iterate back and forth

The possibilities are endless when you have full context at your fingertips. The pattern is always the same:
- **You think**
- **I augment**
- **You decide**

Any questions about this workflow?"

**STOP: Check for questions**

**CHECK:** Wait for student response

---

**When student says no questions or after answering questions:**

"Awesome work on this module! 🎉

You now know how to partner with AI to write better PRDs faster. You've seen firsthand how AI can be a thinking partner - helping you refine ideas, generate options, and get feedback - without replacing your judgment.

**Module 2.1 Complete!** ✓

Next up, you'll learn how to use data to drive product decisions - from discovering problems in your funnel, to estimating feature impact, to analyzing A/B test results like a pro.

When you're ready, start the next module by running: **`/start-2-2`**

See you in there!"
