## High-Level Overview

**Narrative:** You're a PM at TaskFlow preparing visuals for a pitch deck. TaskFlow is launching a mobile app for operations managers who coordinate tasks across teams in fast-paced environments like manufacturing plants. You need to build a compelling visual story.

- Set the scene: you're pitching TaskFlow Mobile to leadership next week and need visuals
- Remind students they can use `style-library.html` for styles OR just describe what they want
- **Persona:** Create "Marcus Chen" - operations manager at a manufacturing plant, manages 3 shift supervisors, needs to track tasks on the floor
- **Journey map:** Map Marcus's morning workflow - checking overnight tasks, assigning priorities, tracking completion through his shift
- **Wireframe transformation:** You sketched the app idea in a meeting (`hand-drawn-wireframe.jpg`) - now transform it into a polished wireframe
- **Device mockup:** Put the polished wireframe into an iPhone frame for the pitch deck
- **Lifestyle shot:** Show Marcus on the factory floor using TaskFlow on his phone - this is the hero image for your pitch
- Wrap up: you just built a complete visual narrative for a product pitch in minutes

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 3.2.1: Users & Product Visuals
- You've learned the fundamentals of image generation - now let's put them to work on real PM tasks
- Quick reminder: TaskFlow is the fictional company for this course - a B2B SaaS platform for team task management
- Here's the scenario: you're a PM at TaskFlow, and you're pitching a new mobile app to leadership next week
- The app is for operations managers in manufacturing - people who coordinate tasks across shifts on the factory floor
- You need visuals for your pitch deck: a persona, a journey map, wireframes, and a hero image
- By the end of this module, you'll have built all of them
- STOP: Ready to start building your pitch deck visuals?
- USER: Ready

- Quick reminder: you have two ways to work with image generation
- Option 1: Pick a style from your `style-library.html` (e.g., "use style #9") – introduced in 3.1.4. Let me know if you need help accessing it
- Option 2: Just describe what you want and I'll figure out the rest
- Both work great - use whichever feels natural
- STOP: Makes sense?
- USER: Yes

### Part 1: Persona Portrait

- First, every good pitch starts with "who are we building for?"
- Let's create a persona portrait for your pitch deck
- Meet Marcus Chen - he's an operations manager at a manufacturing plant
- He manages 3 shift supervisors and needs to track tasks across the factory floor
- Mid-40s, practical, always has his phone in one hand and a coffee in the other
- STOP: Ask me to create a persona portrait of Marcus for your pitch deck
- USER: Create a persona portrait of Marcus / Generate Marcus Chen
- ACTION: Generate persona portrait of Marcus Chen
	- Operations manager, mid-40s, manufacturing environment
	- Confident but approachable expression
	- Wearing practical work attire (polo or button-down, maybe safety vest)
	- Use a style appropriate for pitch decks (professional but not stock-photo sterile)
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Open the outputs folder to see Marcus
- STOP: What do you think? Does he look like someone who runs a factory floor?
- USER: Response
- That's your "who we're building for" slide sorted
- STOP: Ready to show leadership what Marcus's day looks like?
- USER: Yes

---

### Part 2: Journey Map

- A journey map shows the pain points we're solving
- Let's map Marcus's morning workflow - this is where TaskFlow Mobile helps most
- His morning goes something like this:
	- 6 AM: Arrives, checks overnight shift handoff notes
	- 6:30 AM: Reviews task backlog, assigns priorities for day shift
	- 7 AM: Morning standup with shift supervisors
	- 8-11 AM: Walks the floor, tracks task completion, handles issues
	- 11:30 AM: Prepares handoff notes for afternoon shift
- Currently he does all this with clipboard, radio, and scattered texts
- STOP: Ask me to create a journey map showing Marcus's morning workflow
- USER: Create a journey map / Generate the journey map
- ACTION: Generate journey map visualization
	- Marcus's morning workflow from 6 AM to noon
	- Show stages: Arrive → Review → Standup → Floor Walk → Handoff
	- Include pain points at each stage (scattered info, manual tracking, delayed updates)
	- Clean, presentation-ready style (16:9 aspect ratio)
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the outputs folder for your journey map
- STOP: See how it visualizes the problem you're solving?
- USER: Response

---

- Remember: you can always ask for changes
- Don't like the style? Just ask - "make it more playful" or "try a hand-drawn look"
- You can also reference the style library - for example, "regenerate this using style #59" for an illustrated version
- STOP: Want to try a different style, or are you happy with this one?
- USER: Response (either asks for change or continues)
- ACTION: If user wants a change, regenerate with their requested style. If satisfied, continue.
- Now leadership can see exactly where TaskFlow Mobile fits into Marcus's day
- STOP: Ready to show them what the solution looks like?
- USER: Yes

### Part 3: Wireframe Transformation

- Here's a common PM scenario: you sketched an idea in a meeting and now need to make it presentable
- ACTION: Get the path to `hand-drawn-wireframe.jpg` in this module folder
- Open this file to see it: [provide path]
- This is your "meeting sketch" - a quick wireframe you drew while thinking about Marcus's needs
- STOP: Do you see the sketch? Notice the TaskFlow header, the shift overview, the task assignments?
- USER: Yes, I see it

---

- Now let's transform this rough sketch into a polished wireframe for your pitch deck
- STOP: Ask me to transform this hand-drawn sketch into a clean, polished wireframe
- USER: Transform this into a polished wireframe / Clean up this sketch
- ACTION: Generate polished wireframe using hand-drawn-wireframe.jpg as reference
	- Transform the rough sketch into a clean, professional wireframe
	- Keep the same layout and elements (header, greeting, task list, shift overview, nav)
	- Clean lines, consistent spacing, professional typography
	- Mobile screen aspect ratio (9:16 or similar)
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the outputs folder - you should see your polished wireframe
- STOP: Compare the sketch to the polished version. See how it preserved your ideas but made them presentation-ready?
- USER: Response
- In minutes, you went from meeting sketch to pitch-ready wireframe
- STOP: Ready to make it look even more real?
- USER: Yes

---

### Part 4: Device Mockup

- Wireframes are great, but stakeholders love seeing the app "in a phone"
- Let's put your polished wireframe into an iPhone frame
- STOP: Ask me to put the wireframe into an iPhone mockup
- USER: Put this in an iPhone / Create a device mockup
- ACTION: Generate device mockup with the polished wireframe
	- iPhone frame (modern model)
	- Clean background (white or subtle gradient)
	- Slight shadow for depth
	- Professional, pitch-deck ready
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the outputs folder for your device mockup
- STOP: Now it looks like a real app, right?
- USER: Response
- Perfect for your pitch deck - but we can go one step further
- STOP: Ready to create the hero image?
- USER: Yes

---

### Part 5: Lifestyle Shot

- The hero image is what sells the vision
- Let's show Marcus actually using TaskFlow on the factory floor
- This brings everything together: your persona, in their environment, using your product
- STOP: Ask me to create a lifestyle shot of Marcus using TaskFlow on the factory floor
- USER: Create a lifestyle shot / Show Marcus using the app on the factory floor
- ACTION: Generate lifestyle shot
	- Marcus (operations manager, mid-40s) on a manufacturing floor
	- Holding phone showing TaskFlow interface
	- Factory environment in background (equipment, workers, industrial setting)
	- Natural lighting, authentic feel
	- Composition suitable for a hero image or pitch deck cover
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the outputs folder for your hero image
- STOP: This is your pitch deck cover right here. What do you think?
- USER: Response
