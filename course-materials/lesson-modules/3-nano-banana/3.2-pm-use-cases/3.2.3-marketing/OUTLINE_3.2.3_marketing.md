# Module 3.2.3: Marketing & Launch Assets - Outline

## Files Needed to Start
- `image_gen.py` - Pre-built image generation module (in course root)
- `.env` - Already configured with API key (from 3.1.1)
- `style-library.html` - Style library from 3.1.4 (students can reference styles)

## Files Created During Module
- `outputs/app_store_*.png` - App store feature graphic / hero banner
- `outputs/social_ad_*.png` - Social media ad creative(s)
- `outputs/feature_announcement_*.png` - Feature announcement graphic for blog/email/social

## High-Level Overview

**Narrative:** You did it. The pitch landed, the CTO signed off on the architecture, the CEO approved the roadmap, and the board gave the green light. TaskFlow Mobile is launching next month. Now marketing needs assets - and they needed them yesterday. You're going to create launch visuals on demand.

- Set the scene: TaskFlow Mobile got the green light, launch is next month, marketing needs assets fast
- Remind users they can reference `style-library.html` or describe what they want
- **App Store Hero:** Create a feature graphic for the App Store / Play Store listing - the first thing users see when they find TaskFlow Mobile
- **Social Ad Creative:** Create ad variants for social campaigns (LinkedIn for B2B, maybe Instagram/Facebook) - show the app solving Marcus's problem
- **Feature Announcement Graphic:** Create a visual for the launch blog post / email announcement / social post - "Introducing TaskFlow Mobile"
- Wrap up: you just created a complete launch asset kit in minutes
- **Final capstone - drive home the thesis:**
  - You now understand how the most powerful image generation model ever made works - inside and out
  - You've learned how to supercharge it by pairing it with Claude Code - natural language commands, instant iteration, no context switching
  - You built a reusable, compounding system - your style library grows more valuable with every project
  - This is the unlock: the most powerful model + the most powerful coding assistant + a system that compounds over time
  - Most people use AI image tools as one-off novelties - you now have a professional-grade creative pipeline
- Congratulate the user on completing Nano Banana

### Part 1: App Store Hero

- First up: the App Store feature graphic
- This is the hero image users see when they find TaskFlow Mobile in the App Store or Play Store
- It needs to communicate the value instantly - "task management for teams on the go"
- Think: the app on a phone, maybe showing Marcus's workflow, clean and professional
- STOP: Ask me to create an App Store feature graphic for TaskFlow Mobile
- USER: Create an App Store feature graphic / Generate the app store hero
- ACTION: Generate App Store feature graphic
	- TaskFlow Mobile app displayed on a modern phone
	- Show the task management interface (can reference earlier wireframe aesthetic)
	- Clean, professional style suitable for app store listing
	- Maybe subtle manufacturing/operations context in background
	- 16:9 aspect ratio (standard for feature graphics)
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the `outputs/` folder for your App Store graphic
- STOP: Does this make you want to download the app?
- USER: Response
- ACTION: If user wants changes, iterate. If satisfied, continue.
- That's your app store presence sorted
- STOP: Ready for the ad campaign?
- USER: Yes

---

### Part 2: Social Ad Creative

- Next: social media ads
- TaskFlow is B2B, so LinkedIn is the primary channel - but these work for any platform
- A good ad creative shows the problem and the solution in one glance
- Let's create an ad showing operations managers going from chaos (clipboard, scattered texts) to clarity (TaskFlow Mobile)
- STOP: Ask me to create a social ad showing the before/after transformation
- USER: Create a social ad / Generate the LinkedIn ad
- ACTION: Generate social ad creative
	- Split or comparison concept: chaos vs clarity
	- Left/before: overwhelmed manager with clipboard, radio, scattered papers
	- Right/after: same manager confidently using TaskFlow Mobile
	- Bold, attention-grabbing style suitable for social feeds
	- Include space for headline text (or generate with text)
	- 1:1 aspect ratio (works across platforms)
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the `outputs/` folder for your ad creative
- STOP: Can you see the transformation story in a single image?
- USER: Response
- ACTION: If user wants changes, iterate. If satisfied, continue.

---

- Want to try a variant?
- Different ad styles work for different audiences - maybe a more polished corporate look, or something more dynamic
- STOP: Want to generate an alternate version, or move on to the announcement graphic?
- USER: Response (alternate version or continue)
- ACTION: If user wants alternate, generate another variant with different style. If they want to continue, proceed to Part 3.
- STOP: Ready for the launch announcement?
- USER: Yes

---

### Part 3: Feature Announcement Graphic

- Final asset: the launch announcement graphic
- This goes in the blog post, the email blast, the social announcement - everywhere you're saying "TaskFlow Mobile is here"
- It should feel like an event - something new and exciting is arriving
- Think: "Introducing TaskFlow Mobile" energy
- STOP: Ask me to create a launch announcement graphic
- USER: Create a launch announcement / Generate the announcement graphic
- ACTION: Generate launch announcement graphic
	- "Introducing TaskFlow Mobile" visual concept
	- Hero shot of the app - polished, premium feel
	- Launch/announcement energy (could be subtle motion blur, spotlight effect, or clean reveal aesthetic)
	- Professional enough for press release, exciting enough for social
	- 16:9 aspect ratio
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the `outputs/` folder for your announcement graphic
- STOP: Does this feel like a launch moment?
- USER: Response
- ACTION: If user wants changes, iterate. If satisfied, continue.
- Perfect - you now have your launch announcement ready to go
- STOP: One more thing before we wrap up
- USER: Yes

### Wrap-Up

### The Big Picture

- Let's zoom out for a moment
- Think about what you've actually built in this course
- STOP: Ready for the thesis?
- USER: Yes

---

- You now understand how the most powerful image generation model ever made works - inside and out
- You know the prompting principles, the session mechanics, how to iterate, when to use references
- But that's just the foundation
- STOP: Here's where it gets interesting
- USER: Continue

---

- You've learned how to supercharge Gemini by pairing it with Claude Code
- Natural language commands - no clicking through menus
- Instant iteration - "make it bluer" and it happens
- No context switching - you stay in your flow
- This is faster and more powerful than any wrapper app
- STOP: Makes sense?
- USER: Yes

---

- And here's the real unlock: you built a compounding system
- Your style library in `style-library.html` grows more valuable with every project
- Every style you extract, every prompt you save - it compounds
- Next time you need a journey map, you've got your go-to style ready
- Next time you need an architecture diagram, same thing
- STOP: See how this is different from using AI image tools as one-off novelties?
- USER: Yes

---

- Most people generate random images and forget about them
- You now have a professional-grade creative pipeline:
	- The most powerful model (Gemini)
	- The most powerful AI assistant (Claude Code)
	- A system that compounds over time (your style library)
- This is how you actually leverage AI for real work
- STOP: Any questions about what you've built?
- USER: Response
