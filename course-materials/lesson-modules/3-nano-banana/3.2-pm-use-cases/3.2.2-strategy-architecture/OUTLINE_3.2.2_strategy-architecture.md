# Module 3.2.2: Strategy & Architecture Visuals - Outline

## Files Needed to Start
- `image_gen.py` - Pre-built image generation module (in course root)
- `.env` - Already configured with API key (from 3.1.1)
- `style-library.html` - Style library from 3.1.4 (students can reference styles)

## Files Created During Module
- `outputs/architecture_*.png` - System architecture diagram
- `outputs/framework_*.png` - Strategy framework visualization (2x2 matrix or similar)
- `outputs/roadmap_*.png` - Product roadmap or timeline visualization

## High-Level Overview

**Narrative:** Leadership loved your pitch deck from 3.2.1. Now different stakeholders want deeper dives. The CTO wants to understand how TaskFlow Mobile fits into the existing system. The CEO wants to see the strategic prioritization. And the board wants to see the product roadmap. You need visuals that communicate complex ideas clearly.

- Set the scene: your pitch was a hit, now stakeholders want more detail
- Remind users they can reference `style-library.html` or just describe what they want
- **System Architecture:** CTO meeting - create a diagram showing how TaskFlow Mobile connects to the existing TaskFlow backend, databases, and third-party integrations (styles #34, #35, #33 are good options)
- **Strategy Framework:** CEO meeting - create a 2x2 prioritization matrix showing which features to build first - impact vs effort (styles #5, #6 are good options)
- **Product Roadmap:** Board meeting - create a visual timeline showing the phased rollout of TaskFlow Mobile over the next 3 quarters (styles #88, #90 are good options)
- Remind users: you can always add your own types of graphics and styles to the style database - check out 3.1.4 if you need a reminder on how
- Wrap up: you can now visualize complex strategic and technical concepts on demand

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 3.2.2: Strategy & Architecture Visuals
- Your TaskFlow Mobile pitch was a hit - leadership is excited
- But now different stakeholders want deeper dives
- The CTO wants to understand the technical architecture
- The CEO wants to see feature prioritization
- And the board wants to see the product roadmap
- You need visuals that communicate complex ideas clearly - let's build them
- STOP: Ready to prep for your stakeholder meetings?
- USER: Ready

---

- Quick reminder: you can reference styles from `style-library.html` or just describe what you want
- The Architecture and Framework categories have great options for this module
- STOP: Makes sense?
- USER: Yes

### Part 1: System Architecture (CTO Meeting)

- First up: the CTO meeting
- The CTO wants to understand how TaskFlow Mobile fits into the existing TaskFlow ecosystem
- Let's create a system architecture diagram showing:
	- TaskFlow Mobile app (the new thing)
	- TaskFlow Backend API (existing)
	- Database layer (PostgreSQL, Redis cache)
	- Third-party integrations (push notifications, analytics)
	- How data flows between them
- This is the kind of diagram that answers "how does it all connect?"
- STOP: Ask me to create a system architecture diagram for TaskFlow Mobile
- USER: Create a system architecture diagram / Generate the architecture diagram
- ACTION: Generate system architecture diagram
	- TaskFlow Mobile connecting to TaskFlow Backend API
	- Backend connecting to PostgreSQL database and Redis cache
	- Third-party services: push notifications (Firebase), analytics (Mixpanel)
	- Show data flow arrows between components
	- Clean, technical style suitable for engineering review (style #34 or similar)
	- 16:9 aspect ratio
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the `outputs/` folder for your architecture diagram
- STOP: Does this clearly show how the pieces connect?
- USER: Response
- ACTION: If user wants changes, iterate. If satisfied, continue.
- The CTO can now see exactly how TaskFlow Mobile integrates with the existing system
- STOP: Ready for the CEO meeting?
- USER: Yes

---

### Part 2: Strategy Framework (CEO Meeting)

- Next: the CEO meeting
- The CEO wants to see how you're prioritizing features - what gets built first and why
- A 2x2 matrix is perfect for this: Impact vs Effort
- Let's map out the key features for TaskFlow Mobile:
	- **Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort):** Push notifications for task updates, offline task viewing
	- **Major Projects (High Impact, High Effort):** Real-time sync across devices, team chat integration
	- **Fill-ins (Low Impact, Low Effort):** Custom themes, widget support
	- **Avoid (Low Impact, High Effort):** Voice command support, AR task visualization
- STOP: Ask me to create a 2x2 prioritization matrix for TaskFlow Mobile features
- USER: Create a prioritization matrix / Generate the 2x2 matrix
- ACTION: Generate 2x2 prioritization matrix
	- X-axis: Effort (Low → High)
	- Y-axis: Impact (Low → High)
	- Four quadrants labeled: Quick Wins, Major Projects, Fill-ins, Avoid
	- Plot the features mentioned above in appropriate quadrants
	- Clean corporate style suitable for executive presentation (style #5 or similar)
	- 1:1 or 16:9 aspect ratio
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the `outputs/` folder for your prioritization matrix
- STOP: See how the matrix makes the prioritization logic visual and clear?
- USER: Response
- ACTION: If user wants changes, iterate. If satisfied, continue.
- Now the CEO can see at a glance what you're building first and why
- STOP: Ready for the board meeting?
- USER: Yes

---

### Part 3: Product Roadmap (Board Meeting)

- Finally: the board meeting
- The board wants to see the big picture - when does this ship and what's the phased rollout?
- Let's create a roadmap showing TaskFlow Mobile over 3 quarters:
	- **Q1:** MVP launch - core task management, push notifications, offline viewing
	- **Q2:** Team features - real-time sync, team chat integration, shared task lists
	- **Q3:** Enterprise - admin controls, SSO integration, advanced analytics
- This shows a clear path from MVP to enterprise-ready
- STOP: Ask me to create a product roadmap for TaskFlow Mobile
- USER: Create a product roadmap / Generate the roadmap
- ACTION: Generate product roadmap visualization
	- Timeline showing Q1, Q2, Q3
	- Each quarter with key milestones/features
	- Q1: MVP (core features)
	- Q2: Team features (collaboration)
	- Q3: Enterprise (admin/security)
	- Clean, modern style suitable for board presentation (style #88 or similar)
	- 16:9 aspect ratio
- ACTION: Provide path to output image
- Check the `outputs/` folder for your roadmap
- STOP: Does this tell a clear story of how the product evolves?
- USER: Response
- ACTION: If user wants changes, iterate. If satisfied, continue.
- The board can now see the strategic vision laid out over time
- STOP: One more thing before we wrap up
- USER: Yes

### Growing Your Style Library

- Remember: you can always add your own styles to the style database
- Found a diagram style you love online? Extract it and save it
- Created something in this module that worked really well? Add it to your library
- Over time, you'll build a collection of go-to styles for every situation
- If you need a refresher on how to add styles, revisit Module 3.1.4
- STOP: Makes sense?
- USER: Yes

---

### Wrap-Up

- Let's recap what you just built:
	- A system architecture diagram for the CTO
	- A 2x2 prioritization matrix for the CEO
	- A product roadmap for the board
- Three different stakeholders, three different visual needs - all handled
- These techniques work for any strategic or technical communication:
	- Architecture reviews
	- Strategy presentations
	- Planning sessions
	- Board updates
- STOP: Any questions before we move on?
- USER: Questions or ready to continue

---

- In the next module, we'll tackle marketing and announcement visuals - ads, feature graphics, and launch assets
- STOP: Ready for Module 3.2.3?
- USER: Ready
- Great! Type `/start-3-2-3` to continue
