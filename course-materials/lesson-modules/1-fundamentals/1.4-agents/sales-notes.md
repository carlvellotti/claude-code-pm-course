## Lost Deals

### Deal #1: Velocity Logistics
- **Deal Size:** $156,000 ARR (300 seats)
- **Lost to:** Asana
- **Sales Rep:** Marcus Chen
- **Notes:**
  > "Their ops team is 70% field workers. When they saw we didn't have a mobile app, the conversation basically ended. Asana won because of their mobile app, even though our desktop features were stronger. Direct quote from their COO: 'We can't deploy a tool our field team can't use.'"

### Deal #2: Summit Healthcare Group
- **Deal Size:** $89,000 ARR (120 seats)
- **Lost to:** Monday.com
- **Sales Rep:** Ashley Rodriguez
- **Notes:**
  > "Healthcare = nurses and staff constantly moving between rooms. They need to check tasks on tablets/phones. Our mobile web was too slow in their demo. Monday's native app was 'night and day better' according to their IT director."

### Deal #3: Frontier Construction
- **Deal Size:** $67,000 ARR (85 seats)
- **Lost to:** Procore (industry-specific)
- **Sales Rep:** David Kim
- **Notes:**
  > "Construction job sites have limited connectivity. They specifically asked about offline mode. When I explained we don't have a native app, they said 'that's a non-starter.' Lost to a more expensive but mobile-first competitor."

### Deal #4: NexGen Events
- **Deal Size:** $42,000 ARR (50 seats)
- **Lost to:** Asana
- **Sales Rep:** Rachel Green
- **Notes:**
  > "Event management company. Their team lives on their phones during events. Showed them mobile web, they laughed. Not meanly, but like 'you can't be serious.' Went with Asana within a week."

### Deal #5: Pacific Retail Group
- **Deal Size:** $112,000 ARR (200 seats)
- **Lost to:** Monday.com
- **Sales Rep:** James Wilson
- **Notes:**
  > "Retail = store managers who don't have desktops. Mobile is their primary device. We were their first choice based on features until the mobile conversation. Their exact words: 'Love the product, can't use the product.'"

### CloudScale Technologies
- **Current ARR:** $180,000
- **Renewal Date:** March 2025

### Meridian Financial Services
- **Current ARR:** $95,000
- **Renewal Date:** January 2025
- **Risk Level:** Medium

### Atlas Manufacturing
- **Current ARR:** $240,000
- **Renewal Date:** February 2025
- **Risk Level:** Critical

## Win-Back Opportunities If Mobile Launches

Several lost prospects indicated they would reconsider TaskFlow if we launched a quality mobile app:

1. **Velocity Logistics** - "Call us when you have mobile" - $156k opportunity
2. **Summit Healthcare** - "We liked everything else about TaskFlow" - $89k opportunity
3. **NexGen Events** - "Would switch back if mobile was solid" - $42k opportunity

**Potential win-back ARR:** $287,000+

## Sales Team Recommendation

The lack of a mobile app is no longer a "nice to have" objection - it's becoming a primary disqualifier in 30%+ of our deals, particularly in:
- Healthcare
- Construction/Field Services
- Retail
- Events/Hospitality
- Any company with >40% mobile workforce

**Request:** Prioritize native mobile app development. Sales team willing to participate in beta testing and customer recruitment for early access program.
