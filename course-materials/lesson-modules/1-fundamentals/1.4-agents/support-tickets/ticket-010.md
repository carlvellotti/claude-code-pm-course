## Subject: Mobile experience killing our productivity

## Description

Hi TaskFlow,

We're a fully remote marketing agency. "Remote" means we work from everywhere - home offices, co-working spaces, airports, cafes. Mobile access isn't a luxury, it's essential.

The current mobile web experience is hurting us:
- Page loads take 10-15 seconds on average
- Frequently get logged out mid-task
- Images/attachments barely load
- No way to get notified without keeping browser open

We've tried everything:
- Adding to home screen (still slow)
- Different browsers (Safari, Chrome - same issues)
- Clearing cache regularly (temporary fix at best)

My team has started using Slack threads to coordinate instead of TaskFlow because at least Slack works on mobile. That defeats the purpose of having TaskFlow.

Is a mobile app anywhere on the roadmap? Even a basic one would be better than what we have now.

Nina

## Internal Notes

- Remote agency = 100% distributed workforce
- Shadow tool usage (Slack replacing TaskFlow for coordination)
- CEO directly expressing frustration
- Good company for testimonial if mobile launches
- Pro tier but potential to upgrade with better mobile
