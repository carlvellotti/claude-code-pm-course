## Subject: Any plans for iPhone app?

## Description

Hey! Love TaskFlow for managing my freelance projects.

Just wondering if there are any plans for an iPhone app? I do a lot of work from coffee shops and my phone, would be great to have a proper app instead of the website.

Not urgent, just curious!

Jenny
