## Subject: Linear has a mobile app, why doesn't TaskFlow?

## Description

Honest question - why doesn't TaskFlow have a mobile app in 2024?

We're a game development studio. Half our team uses TaskFlow (production, art, design) and half uses Linear (engineering). The engineers keep smugly showing off their Linear mobile app while our production team struggles with TaskFlow mobile web.

It's becoming a point of friction. Engineers are asking why we don't just consolidate on Linear. The only reason we haven't is because TaskFlow is better for non-engineering workflows.

But if Linear ships better cross-team features, and TaskFlow still doesn't have a mobile app... we might have to reconsider.

Just wanted to give you that honest feedback.

Kevin

## Internal Notes

- Gaming vertical (design-heavy teams)
- Split tooling situation (TaskFlow vs Linear)
- Consolidation risk is real
- Linear cited as competitive threat
- 80 seats = significant revenue at risk
