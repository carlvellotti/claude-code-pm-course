## Subject: Offline mode desperately needed

## Description

Hello TaskFlow support,

We manage live events - conferences, trade shows, corporate events. During events, we're running around venues that often have terrible WiFi.

We need to:
- Check task assignments
- Update task status
- Add notes/photos from the floor
- Coordinate with team members

Currently, TaskFlow mobile web just spins forever when there's poor connectivity. We've resorted to using a shared Google Doc as our "offline" task list during events, then manually updating TaskFlow afterward. It's a mess.

An offline-capable mobile app would be a game-changer for our industry. Is this on your roadmap?

Derek

## Internal Notes

- Events/hospitality vertical
- Offline is a hard requirement for their use case
- Workaround (Google Docs) shows commitment to TaskFlow
- Good candidate for case study if we launch mobile
- Similar feedback from 3 other event companies
