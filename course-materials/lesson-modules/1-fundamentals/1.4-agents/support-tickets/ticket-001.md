## Subject: Mobile app availability for iOS/Android?

## Description

Hi TaskFlow team,

Our team has been asking about mobile app availability. We currently have to use the mobile web version which is quite slow and doesn't support offline access.

Key questions:
1. Is there a native mobile app planned?
2. If so, what's the estimated timeline?
3. Will it support our SSO (Okta)?

Several team members have mentioned this is becoming a blocker for field staff adoption.

Thanks,
Linda
