## Subject: Push notifications for mobile?

## Description

Hello,

Quick question - is there any way to get push notifications for TaskFlow on mobile?

Right now I only find out about urgent task updates when I happen to check the app (mobile web). By then it's often too late. I've missed several deadlines because I didn't see the notification in time.

Our team is very mobile - lots of client meetings, events, travel. We need to stay connected to TaskFlow without having it open constantly.

I know you don't have a native app, but is there any workaround for notifications?

Best,
Sarah
