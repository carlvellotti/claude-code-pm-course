## Subject: Mobile access critical for clinical staff

## Description

Hi there,

We're a medical practice using TaskFlow to manage our administrative tasks and patient follow-ups. Our clinical staff (nurses, MAs) are constantly moving between exam rooms and rarely sit at computers.

Current problems:
- Mobile web is too slow between patients (need instant access)
- Can't quickly check/update tasks during brief moments
- HIPAA concerns about using personal phones with browser history
- Need app-level PIN/biometric lock

Is there a mobile app planned? For healthcare, mobile access isn't optional - it's how our staff works.

We're considering switching to a competitor that has a mobile app, but we really prefer TaskFlow's features otherwise.

Amanda
