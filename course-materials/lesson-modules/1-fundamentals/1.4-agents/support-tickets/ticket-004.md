## Subject: Mobile app requirement for enterprise rollout

## Description

Hi TaskFlow team,

We're in the process of rolling out TaskFlow across our entire engineering organization (150 people). However, our security team has raised concerns about the lack of a native mobile app.

Specifically:
1. Mobile web doesn't integrate with our MDM (Mobile Device Management)
2. We can't enforce app-level security policies
3. No way to remote wipe TaskFlow data if a device is lost
4. Browser-based access is harder to audit

These are blockers for full enterprise deployment. We can proceed with desktop users, but ~40% of our team needs mobile access for on-call rotations and incident response.

What's the roadmap for a native mobile app with enterprise security features?

Robert
