## Subject: URGENT - Field workers can't use TaskFlow on job sites

## Description

We're a construction company and most of our team works on job sites, not in offices. They only have phones, not laptops.

The mobile website is basically unusable:
- Takes 30+ seconds to load a board
- Constantly logs us out
- Can't upload photos from phone easily
- No offline access (job sites often have poor signal)

We switched from Asana specifically for TaskFlow's features, but we didn't realize there was no mobile app. Our field team (15 people) has basically stopped using TaskFlow entirely because of this.

Is there any workaround? Or should we be looking at other tools?

Mike
