## Subject: Mobile app as condition for contract renewal

## Description

Team,

I'll be direct: our contract renews in February 2025. A native mobile app with offline capabilities is now a requirement for renewal, not a nice-to-have.

Our situation:
- 60% of our workforce is on the manufacturing floor
- They have tablets/phones but no desktop access
- Current mobile web experience has been "consistently disappointing" (their words)
- We've had to create a parallel system using paper checklists

We've been a TaskFlow customer for 2 years and generally happy with the desktop product. But we can't keep paying enterprise prices for a tool that only works for 40% of our employees.

I need to know by December 1st whether a mobile app will be available in 2025 so we can make our renewal decision.

Tom Bradley
COO
