## Key Quotes

**On current mobile experience:**
> "I check TaskFlow probably 20 times a day, but I'd say half of those are from my phone. The mobile web experience is... functional, but painfully slow. Loading a board takes forever on cellular."

**On specific pain points:**
> "The killer scenario is standup. I'm walking my dog at 9am, standup starts, and I need to quickly update my tasks or check what my team committed to. By the time the mobile site loads, I've missed the context."

**On competitor comparison:**
> "Linear's mobile app is buttery smooth. I've actually caught myself wishing we used Linear just for the mobile experience, even though TaskFlow is better for everything else."

**On what they'd use mobile for:**
> "Quick status updates, checking assignments, maybe adding a quick task when something comes up in a meeting. I don't need to do complex board editing on mobile - just the quick stuff."

## Willingness to Pay

> "If there was a mobile app that actually worked well? I'd push for us to upgrade to whatever tier includes it. Easily worth an extra $2-3 per seat per month."

## Summary

Heavy mobile user currently frustrated by web experience. Would increase engagement significantly with native app. Price-insensitive if quality is there.
