## Key Quotes

**On mobile use case:**
> "Design feedback doesn't stop when I leave the office. Stakeholders send comments at all hours. I want to at least read and acknowledge them quickly from my phone, even if I do the actual design work on desktop."

**On notification gaps:**
> "I have Slack notifications, email notifications, but no TaskFlow notifications on mobile. So I find out about urgent TaskFlow comments... through Slack messages asking if I saw the TaskFlow comment. The indirection is silly."

**On visual needs:**
> "I attached a mockup to a task. On mobile web, the image preview is tiny and I can't zoom properly. For a visual person, that's brutal. I need to see the context."

**On collaborative scenarios:**
> "Design reviews happen in person a lot. Someone asks 'what's the status of the checkout redesign?' and I'm fumbling with mobile web while they wait. With Linear, their designers just pull it up instantly."

## Feature Requests

1. Better image viewing and zooming
2. Push notifications with preview
3. Quick reactions/emoji responses to comments
4. Attachment uploads from camera roll

## Competitive Pressure

> "The design community talks. When I mention we use TaskFlow, I always get the 'but no mobile app?' response. It's becoming a reputation thing."

---

## Willingness to Pay

> "Our ops team controls the budget, but I'd make the case. A real mobile app would save me probably 30 minutes a day of frustration. That's worth paying for."

---

## Summary

Design-specific use cases around visual content and quick feedback. Mobile gap causing reputation concerns in design community. Moderate urgency but strong preference for native experience.
