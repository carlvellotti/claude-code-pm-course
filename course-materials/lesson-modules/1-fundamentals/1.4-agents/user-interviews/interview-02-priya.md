## Key Quotes

**On mobile usage context:**
> "I'm on planes probably twice a week. That's 4-6 hours where I could be reviewing tickets, prioritizing backlog, responding to comments. Instead I just... can't, because TaskFlow mobile web is unusable offline."

**On current workarounds:**
> "I've started screenshotting my board before flights. It's embarrassing. I screenshot a project management tool because I can't access it properly."

**On team impact:**
> "My team knows that when I'm traveling, I basically go dark on TaskFlow. They've learned to not expect responses. That's not great for a PM."

**On desired functionality:**
> "I don't need everything. Give me: view my tasks, read and respond to comments, update status. That's 80% of what I need on mobile."

## Feature Requests

1. Offline mode (critical for flights)
2. Comment replies with @mentions
3. Drag-and-drop status changes
4. Dark mode (for planes)

## Competitive Pressure

> "Our engineering team just adopted Linear for their internal work. When I asked why, they said 'mobile app.' That stings because I championed TaskFlow."

---

## Willingness to Pay

> "We're on the Business tier. I'd advocate for Enterprise if it came with a solid mobile app. We're talking maybe $10k more per year, but the productivity gain would justify it."

---

## Summary

Power user whose productivity drops significantly during travel. Mobile app would unlock ~10 hours/week of previously dead time. Strong internal champion but losing credibility due to mobile gap.
