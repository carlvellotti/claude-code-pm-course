## Key Quotes

**On mobile necessity:**
> "As a founder, I'm never at my desk. I'm in Ubers, walking between meetings, grabbing coffee. That's when I need to check in on what's happening. A desktop-only tool is basically a part-time tool for me."

**On current frustration:**
> "I literally bought an iPad just to have a better TaskFlow experience on the go. That's insane. I spent $800 to work around your lack of a mobile app."

**On team communication:**
> "My team updates tasks throughout the day. If I can't see those updates until I'm back at my laptop at 7pm, I'm always behind. I'm making decisions with stale information."

**On competitor consideration:**
> "I evaluated Notion, Asana, and Linear before choosing TaskFlow. TaskFlow won on features. But I'll be honest - if we weren't already invested in TaskFlow, the mobile thing might've been a dealbreaker."

## Feature Requests

1. Native app with push notifications
2. Apple Watch complication for task counts

4. Quick capture widget

## Willingness to Pay

> "I'm on your cheapest plan because we're a startup. But mobile? That's existential for how I work. I'd pay 2x what I'm paying now. Easy."

## Summary

Founder persona where mobile isn't a nice-to-have, it's essential to job function. Currently using expensive workarounds. High retention risk if better mobile competitor emerges.
