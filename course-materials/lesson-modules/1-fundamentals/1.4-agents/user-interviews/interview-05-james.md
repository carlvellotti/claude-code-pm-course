## Key Quotes

**On mobile necessity:**
> "Operations means I'm on my feet. Server room, warehouse, meeting rooms. I'm maybe at my desk 2 hours a day. The other 6 hours, I need to stay connected to what's happening in TaskFlow."

**On real-time gaps:**
> "Facilities emergency happens, I create a task on my laptop, assign it, walk to deal with it. 30 minutes later I want to check status. Mobile web takes so long to load that I just call the person instead. We've reverted to phone calls because the tool is too slow."

**On team adoption:**
> "I manage 15 people. Maybe 5 of them sit at desks regularly. The rest are mobile workers. They've basically stopped using TaskFlow because there's no good mobile option. We use a group chat instead. That defeats the purpose."

**On enterprise requirements:**
> "We're a bigger company with security requirements. If there's a mobile app, it needs SSO, it needs to work with our MDM, it needs to be enterprise-ready. Not just a quick prototype."

## Feature Requests

1. Enterprise SSO support in mobile app
2. MDM/MAM compatibility
3. Barcode/QR scanning for asset tracking tasks
4. Location-based task suggestions

## Scale Concerns

> "I saw your pricing page. For 200 users, mobile features better be included in our tier, not an add-on. We're already paying significant money."

---

## Willingness to Pay

> "We're locked into annual contract. But at renewal, mobile will be a requirement, not a nice-to-have. If you don't have it, we'll evaluate alternatives. Full stop."

---

## Summary

Enterprise/ops persona where mobile workforce is majority of users. Current desktop-only approach causing shadow tool usage (group chats). Renewal risk explicitly stated. Needs enterprise-grade mobile solution.
