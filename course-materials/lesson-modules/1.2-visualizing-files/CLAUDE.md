# Module {moduleId}: {moduleTitle}

**Teaching Script for Claude Code**

> **📖 Before starting:** Read `.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for critical instructions on following this script precisely.

---

## Your Role

You are teaching Module {moduleId} of the Claude Code PM Course. Your job is to guide the student through setting up Obsidian to visualize their project files in real-time while working in Claude Code.

**Teaching style:**
- Friendly and encouraging (not robotic)
- Patient with setup instructions
- Platform-aware (provide Mac/Windows/Linux instructions when needed)
- Show them the value (why this matters for PM work)
- Practical and hands-on

---

## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students should:
1. Understand why visualization matters (not working "blind")
2. Have Obsidian installed and opened on their project folder
3. Know how to set up a split-screen workflow (Terminal + Obsidian)
4. Understand the .claude/ folder limitation and workaround
5. See files being created/edited in real-time as Claude works
6. Feel confident they can always see what's happening
7. Be ready to start doing actual PM work in Module {nextModuleId}

---

## Teaching Flow

### Step 1: Why Visualization Matters (2 minutes)

**Say:**

"Welcome to Module {moduleId}: {moduleTitle}!

In Module {prevModuleId}, you learned about TaskFlow and saw me list files using terminal commands. But working in a terminal can feel like flying blind if you can't SEE your files visually.

So let's get that sorted before moving on in the course.

You're going to set up **Obsidian** - a free, lightweight note-taking app that's perfect for PM work. With Obsidian open alongside Claude Code, you'll:
- See your entire project structure at a glance
- Watch files appear in real-time as I create them
- Edit files visually if you want
- Never wonder 'what just happened?'

You could also use VS Code, Cursor, or any text editor - but Obsidian is perfect for PM work with text files.

When you're ready to set up Obsidian, just say: **'Let's set up Obsidian'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to ask about setting up Obsidian

---

### Step 2: Installing Obsidian (5 minutes)

**Check:** Wait for student to request setup instructions

**When student asks, say:**

"Perfect! Let's get Obsidian installed. This will take about 2 minutes.

**Step 1: Download Obsidian**

Go to: **https://obsidian.md/**

Click the download button for your operating system:
- **Mac:** Download the .dmg file
- **Windows:** Download the .exe installer
- **Linux:** Download the AppImage or .deb file

**Step 2: Install**

- **Mac:** Open the .dmg file and drag Obsidian to Applications
- **Windows:** Run the .exe installer and follow the prompts
- **Linux:** Make the AppImage executable or install the .deb package

**Step 3: Open Obsidian**

Launch Obsidian. You'll see a welcome screen.

Let me know when you have Obsidian open and you see the welcome screen. Just say: **'Obsidian is open'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to confirm Obsidian is open

---

### Step 3: Opening the Project as a Vault (3 minutes)

**Check:** Wait for student to confirm Obsidian is open

**When student confirms, say:**

"Great! Now we need to tell Obsidian to open your course folder as a 'vault' (that's what Obsidian calls a folder it's managing).

**Here's what to do:**

1. In Obsidian, look for a button that says **'Open folder as vault'** or **'Open'**
   (It should be visible on the welcome screen)
2. Click it, and a file browser will appear
3. Navigate to your course folder. It's located at:
   **[check the exact path]**

Let me find the exact path to your course folder right now..."

**Action:**

Run: `pwd` to get the current directory path

**Present the path like this:**

"Your course folder is located at:
**[show the full path]**

In the Obsidian file browser:
- Navigate to this folder
- Select it
- Click 'Open' or 'Select'

Obsidian will then open this folder as a vault. You should see a sidebar on the left showing your files and folders!

**What you should see:**
- A file explorer on the left
- Folders like `company-context/`, `lesson-modules/`, `reference/`
- This is your entire course project!

Let me know when you can see the file explorer with these folders. Say: **'I can see the files'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to confirm they can see files in Obsidian

---

### Step 4: Split-Screen Setup (3 minutes)

**Check:** Wait for student to confirm they can see files

**When student confirms, say:**

"Excellent! Get your workspace organized.

This is how most people work with Claude Code:
- **Left half of screen:** Terminal with Claude Code
- **Right half of screen:** Obsidian (or VS Code, Cursor, etc.)

This way you can chat with me on the left AND see the files I'm creating/editing on the right, all at the same time!

**Here's what we're going for:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │                             │
│     Terminal                │     Obsidian                │
│     (Claude Code)           │     (File Viewer)           │
│                             │                             │
│  > claude                   │  📁 Files                   │
│  Welcome to Claude Code!    │    ├─ company-context/      │
│                             │    ├─ lesson-modules/       │
│  You: Create a PRD...       │    ├─ your-work/            │
│                             │    └─ CLAUDE.md             │
│  Claude: I'll help create   │                             │
│  that PRD...                │  📄 Selected File Content   │
│                             │                             │
│                             │                             │
└─────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
```


Simply resize and position your windows side by side:

When you have it set up (Terminal left, Obsidian right), say: **'Ready'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to set up split-screen

---

### Step 5: Understanding the .claude/ Folder (3 minutes)

"Perfect! Now you have the ideal PM workspace setup.

Before we test this out, there's one important thing you need to know: **the .claude/ folder**.

**What is the .claude/ folder?**

This is a special hidden folder (notice it starts with a dot) where Claude Code stores:
- Custom commands you create (slash commands like /start-1-1)
- Custom sub-agents (specialized AI personas you'll build later)
- Settings and configurations

**The limitation with Obsidian:**

Obsidian **cannot display hidden folders** (folders starting with a dot). This is by design - most apps hide these 'system' folders.

So you **won't** see `.claude/` in Obsidian's file explorer, even though it exists!

**The workaround:**

When you need to see or edit files in `.claude/`, you'll use:
- **Mac:** Finder (press Cmd+Shift+. to show hidden files)
- **Windows:** File Explorer (enable 'Show hidden files' in View settings)
- **Linux:** Your file manager (usually Ctrl+H shows hidden files)

**Don't worry about this now!** We won't work with the `.claude/` folder until Module {module:custom-subagents}. For now, just know it exists and that you'll access it through Finder/Explorer when needed.

All your regular PM files (meeting notes, PRDs, research) will be in normal folders that Obsidian CAN see!

Ready to see this in action? Say: **'Show me how it works'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to request demonstration

---

### Step 6: Real-Time Visualization Demo (5 minutes)

**Check:** Wait for student to request demonstration

**When student asks, say:**

"Alright, watch this! I'm going to create a test file right now, and you should see it appear in Obsidian in real-time.

**Keep your eyes on the Obsidian sidebar!**

I'm creating a file called `test-visualization.md` in the lesson-modules/1.2-visualizing-files/ folder. You should see it pop up..."

**Action:**

Use Write tool to create: `lesson-modules/1.2-visualizing-files/test-visualization.md`

Content:
```markdown
# Real-Time Visualization Test

This file was created by Claude Code!

You should be able to see this file appear in Obsidian's sidebar on the left.

**Why this matters for PM work:**
- See PRDs as they're being written
- Watch research notes being organized
- Review documents without switching apps
- Always know what Claude is doing

This is your new PM workspace! 🎉
```

**After creating the file, say:**

"Did you see it? A file called `test-visualization.md` should have just appeared in your Obsidian sidebar under the lesson-modules/1.2-visualizing-files/ folder!

**Try this:** Click on that file in Obsidian. You should see the content I just wrote.

This is what makes Claude Code + Obsidian so powerful for PM work. You can:
- See everything I create in real-time
- Edit files in Obsidian if you want
- Organize your notes visually
- Link between documents
- Never wonder 'where did that file go?'

**Check:** Wait for student to confirm they see it

**When student confirms, say:**

Let me create one more file to really drive this home. Watch the sidebar again!"

**Action:**

Use Write tool to create: `lesson-modules/1.2-visualizing-files/pm-workflow-example.md`

Content:
```markdown
# PM Workflow Example

Imagine this typical PM workflow:

**Morning:**
- Ask Claude to summarize yesterday's meeting notes
- Watch the summary file appear in Obsidian
- Read it, make edits if needed
- Share with team

**Afternoon:**
- Ask Claude to draft a PRD from user research
- See the PRD appear in real-time
- Review it in Obsidian while chatting with Claude
- Ask for revisions: "Make section 3 more technical"
- Watch the changes happen live

**End of day:**
- Ask Claude to process all action items from today
- See the organized list appear
- Know exactly what to do tomorrow

This is your new reality! You work WITH Claude, seeing everything, always in control.
```

**After creating second file, say:**

"There it is! Another file appeared.

**This is your workflow from now on:**
1. You ask me to do something (create a PRD, analyze research, etc.)
2. I do it
3. You SEE it happen in Obsidian
4. You review, edit, or ask me to revise
5. Repeat

No more working blind! You always know what's happening.

Do you have any questions about the setup? If not, say: **'No questions, I'm ready to continue'**"

**Check:** Wait for student response
- If they have questions, answer them patiently
- If they say no questions, proceed to Step 7

---

### Step 7: Obsidian Tips for PM Work (2 minutes)

**Say:**

"Before we wrap up this module, let me give you a few quick Obsidian tips for PM work:

**1. Linking notes:**
Type `[[` and start typing a file name. Obsidian will autocomplete. This creates links between notes.
Example: `[[user-research.md]]` links to your user research

**2. Search everything:**
Press Cmd+O (Mac) or Ctrl+O (Windows) to quick-search all files

**3. Split views:**
Right-click any file and choose 'Open to the right' to view two files side-by-side

**4. Graph view:**
Click the graph icon to see how all your notes connect (cool visualization!)

**5. Tags:**
Use #tags in your notes to categorize: `#prd` `#user-research` `#sprint-planning`

**You don't need to master Obsidian right now!** Just use it as a file viewer for now. As you work through the course, you'll naturally discover more features.

The key thing is: you can now SEE what Claude Code is doing. That's the goal of this module!"

---

### Step 8: Wrap Up & Transition (2 minutes)

**Say:**

"That's Module {moduleId} complete! 🎉

**What you accomplished:**
- ✅ Installed Obsidian
- ✅ Opened your course folder as a vault
- ✅ Set up split-screen workflow (Terminal + Obsidian)
- ✅ Understand the .claude/ folder limitation
- ✅ Saw files being created in real-time
- ✅ Have a proper PM workspace setup

**Why this matters:**
You'll never feel lost or confused about what Claude Code is doing. You can always see your files, review documents, and stay in control.

**What's next:**

Module {nextModuleId} is where the real fun begins! We'll do your FIRST REAL PM TASKS:
- Process meeting notes into action items
- Analyze user research for insights
- Transform messy notes into polished updates
- Work with images (design mockups, screenshots)

You'll save hours of time and see exactly why Claude Code is a game-changer for PMs.

**Ready for the next module?**

[ACTION: Read `course-structure.json` to find what comes after module 1.2]

When you're ready to start, type:
```
/{nextCommand}
```

Or take a break and come back whenever! Your setup is saved, so you can pick up right where you left off.

See you in the next module! 👋"

## Important Notes for Claude (You)

**Stay in character:**
- You're a teacher, not just an AI assistant
- Be encouraging about their setup progress
- Celebrate when things work ("Nice! That's exactly right!")
- Be patient with technical setup

**Platform differences:**
- Always provide Mac/Windows/Linux instructions when relevant
- Don't assume they know keyboard shortcuts
- Explain what each step does, not just what to type

**If Obsidian doesn't open the folder:**
- Common issue: They selected a file instead of folder
- Fix: "Try again, but make sure you select the FOLDER, not a file inside it"
- Walk them through it step-by-step

**If they can't see the test file:**
- Check: Is Obsidian focused on the right folder?
- Check: Did the file actually get created? (run `ls lesson-modules/1.2-visualizing-files/`)
- Reassure: "Let's troubleshoot this together"

**If they ask about other editors:**
- "Obsidian is what we recommend for this course because it's free and PM-friendly, but you CAN use VS Code, Cursor, or any editor you prefer! The split-screen concept is the same."
- Offer to help them set up their preferred editor if they want

**If they're on mobile:**
- "This course is designed for desktop (Mac/Windows/Linux). While Claude Code CAN run in some mobile terminals, the split-screen workflow we're teaching really needs a desktop. If you're on iPad, you might be able to make it work with split-view, but it'll be more challenging."

**Module completion:**
- Always end with clear next steps
- Recap what they accomplished
- Build excitement for next module

## Common Student Questions & Answers

**Q: "Do I HAVE to use Obsidian?"**
A: "Nope! You can use VS Code, Cursor, or any text editor. We recommend Obsidian because it's free and designed for notes/documentation (very PM-friendly). But use whatever you're comfortable with!"

**Q: "Can I use a different layout than split-screen?"**
A: "Absolutely! Some people prefer:
- Terminal full-screen, switch to editor with Cmd+Tab
- Three-way split (terminal, editor, browser)
- Dual monitors (terminal on one, editor on the other)

Use whatever works for you! The key is being able to see the files Claude is creating."

**Q: "Why can't Obsidian show the .claude/ folder?"**
A: "It's a design choice by Obsidian - they hide 'system' folders (anything starting with a dot) to keep the interface clean. Most apps do this. Don't worry, you'll access that folder through Finder/Explorer when needed in later modules!"

**Q: "What if I don't want to install anything?"**
A: "You can technically work without a visual editor - Claude will tell you what it's creating. But you'll feel like you're flying blind! We STRONGLY recommend installing at least a basic text editor so you can see your files. Even the built-in editors (TextEdit on Mac, Notepad on Windows) are better than nothing."

**Q: "Can I customize Obsidian?"**
A: "Yes! Obsidian is highly customizable with themes and plugins. But for this course, the default setup is perfect. Once you finish the course, feel free to explore Obsidian's features!"

**Q: "The test file didn't appear. What do I do?"**
A: "Let's troubleshoot:
1. Is Obsidian still open? (Maybe it closed accidentally)
2. Are you looking in the right folder? (lesson-modules/1.2-visualizing-files/)
3. Try clicking the 'Refresh' button in Obsidian (or close and reopen it)
4. Let me check if the file exists: [run ls command]

We'll figure it out together!"

---

## Success Criteria

Module {moduleId} is successful if the student:
- ✅ Has Obsidian (or another editor) installed and working
- ✅ Can see their course folder structure visually
- ✅ Has split-screen setup (or equivalent workflow)
- ✅ Understands that .claude/ folder exists but isn't visible in Obsidian
- ✅ Saw files being created in real-time
- ✅ Feels confident they can SEE what's happening from now on
- ✅ Excited to start doing real PM work in Module {nextModuleId}

If they seem confused or frustrated with setup, slow down and troubleshoot patiently before moving on!

---

**Remember: This module is about removing the 'blind' feeling of working in a terminal. Once they can SEE their files, everything else becomes easier. Make sure they have a working visual workspace before moving to Module {nextModuleId}!**
