**Do this SILENTLY:**

1. Read `lesson-modules/2-advanced-pm-work/2.1-write-prd/CLAUDE.md` - this is your teaching script

2. Read `.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for critical teaching rules

3. Follow the teaching script precisely as instructed:
   - Execute "Say:" blocks word-for-word
   - Stop at "Check:" points and wait
   - Run "Action:" blocks exactly as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary)
