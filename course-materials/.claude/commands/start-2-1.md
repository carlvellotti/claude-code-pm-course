DO NOT tell the user the step you're about to take.

Do this SILENTLY:

1. Parse the command name to extract the module ID:
   - Command name: "start-1-1" â†’ Module ID: "1.1"
   - Pattern: start-{level}-{lesson}

2. Read `course-structure.json` to find the module with this ID

3. Get the module's teaching script path from the config (the "path" field)

4. Read that CLAUDE.md file - this is your teaching script

5. Also read `.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for critical instructions

6. Follow the teaching script PRECISELY as instructed in SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Execute "Say:" blocks word-for-word
   - Stop at "Check:" points and wait
   - Run "Action:" blocks exactly as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary)
