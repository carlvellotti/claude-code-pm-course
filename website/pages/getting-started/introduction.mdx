## 0.0: Introduction

## ðŸ“– Overview

Claude Code is an AI assistant that works directly with your files and folders ON your computer. Unlike traditional chatbots where you manually copy-paste context into it, Claude Code reads your documents, analyzes data, and creates materials directly through natural conversation.

## ðŸ”„ Claude Code vs Traditional Chatbots

| Feature | Traditional Chatbot | Claude Code |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **File Access** | None | Read/write any file on your computer |
| **Memory** | Disappears after session | Permanent project memory (CLAUDE.md) |
| **Execution** | Suggests, but you do it | Actually executes commands and creates files |
| **Multi-file** | One-off responses | Works across dozens of documents simultaneously |
| **Agents** | Single instance | Run multiple agents in parallel |
| **Integrations** | Limited | Connect to Notion, Linear, Slack, GitHub via MCPs |
| **Version Control** | No history | Git integration, checkpoints, rewind |
| **Automation** | Manual copy-paste | True automation with custom commands |

**The difference:** Persistence and execution. Claude Code doesn't just give advice - it does the work with you.


## ðŸ“Š Real Example: Monday.com PM

A product manager at Monday.com used Claude Code to gather and analyze 34,000 Reddit comments about his product. Claude identified patterns, pain points, and priority themes that directly informed the roadmap.

**Impact:** Weeks of manual work â†’ a few hours. This isn't about replacing PM judgment - it's about handling heavy lifting so you focus on strategic thinking.


## ðŸ§  The Mindset Shift

> "Claude Code represents developers becoming orchestrators of incredibly powerful systems rather than command typists." - Peter Steinberger, PDF Expert creator

The same applies to PMs. You're not learning to code - you're learning to orchestrate.

**The shift:**
- From: "I need to learn this command"
- To: "I need this outcome"

Claude Code runs in the terminal, which may feel unfamiliar. But you won't learn terminal commands - you'll have conversations. By the end of Module 0, the terminal is just where you talk to Claude.


## ðŸš€ What's Next?

**Module 0.1:** Installation & Prerequisites

**Module 0.2:** Start Claude Code & Clone the Course

By the end of Module 0.2, you'll have had your first conversation with Claude Code and experienced how this different way of working feels in practice.
