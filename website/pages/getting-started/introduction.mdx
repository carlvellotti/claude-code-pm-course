## 0.0: Introduction

## 🚀 How This Course Works

This course is taught inside Claude Code itself:

1. **Install Claude Code** (Module 0.1) - 15 minutes
2. **Clone this repository with Claude Code** (Module 0.2) - 5 minutes
3. **Type `/start-1-1`** and Claude guides you through interactive lessons

You'll work with real PM files - meeting notes, user research, product data - and learn by doing actual tasks. This website provides reference documentation you can lookup while working through the modules.

## 📖 Overview

Claude Code is an AI assistant that works directly with your files and folders. Unlike traditional chatbots where you copy-paste responses, Claude Code reads your documents, analyzes data, and creates materials through natural conversation.

**Key takeaway:** Claude Code transforms PMs from manual executors into orchestrators. You focus on strategic decisions while Claude handles document synthesis, data analysis, and workflow automation.

## 🔄 Claude Code vs Traditional Chatbots

| Feature | Traditional Chatbot | Claude Code |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **File Access** | None | Read/write any file on your computer |
| **Memory** | Disappears after session | Permanent project memory (CLAUDE.md) |
| **Execution** | Suggests, but you do it | Actually executes commands and creates files |
| **Multi-file** | One-off responses | Works across dozens of documents simultaneously |
| **Agents** | Single instance | Run multiple agents in parallel |
| **Integrations** | Limited | Connect to Notion, Linear, Slack, GitHub via MCPs |
| **Version Control** | No history | Git integration, checkpoints, rewind |
| **Automation** | Manual copy-paste | True automation with custom commands |

**The difference:** Persistence and execution. Claude Code doesn't just give advice - it does the work with you.


## 📊 Real Example: Monday.com PM

A product manager at Monday.com used Claude Code to gather and analyze 34,000 Reddit comments about his product. Claude identified patterns, pain points, and priority themes that directly informed the roadmap.

**Impact:** Weeks of manual work → a few hours. This isn't about replacing PM judgment - it's about handling heavy lifting so you focus on strategic thinking.


## 🧠 The Mindset Shift

> "Claude Code represents developers becoming orchestrators of incredibly powerful systems rather than command typists." - Peter Steinberger, PDF Expert creator

The same applies to PMs. You're not learning to code - you're learning to orchestrate.

**The shift:**
- From: "I need to learn this command"
- To: "I need this outcome"

Claude Code runs in the terminal, which may feel unfamiliar. But you won't learn terminal commands - you'll have conversations. By the end of Module 0, the terminal is just where you talk to Claude.


## 🚀 What's Next?

**Module 0.1:** Installation & Prerequisites

**Module 0.2:** Start Claude Code & Clone the Course

By the end of Module 0.2, you'll have had your first conversation with Claude Code and experienced how this different way of working feels in practice.
