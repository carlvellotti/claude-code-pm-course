## Module 4: Vibe Coding

- **Time to Complete:** 1-2 hours

You've learned to work WITH files. Now learn to CREATE them.

In this module, you'll build a real web app from scratch and deploy it to the internet - no coding experience required. You describe what you want, Claude builds it, you refine it until it's right.

## What You'll Build

A personality quiz app with:
- Multiple questions with custom logic
- Personality type results based on answers
- A live URL anyone can visit

This same process works for landing pages, tools, dashboards, prototypes - anything web-based.

## What You'll Learn

|--------|----------------|
| **4.1: Setup** | The vibecoding mindset and project folder setup |

| **4.3: Build & Iterate** | Scaffold, build, and refine with screenshots |
| **4.4: GitHub** | Version control and backup |
| **4.5: Go Live** | Deploy to Vercel with a real URL |
