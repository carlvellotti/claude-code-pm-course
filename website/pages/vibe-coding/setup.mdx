## 4.1: Setup

- **Time to Complete:** 10 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-4-1` in Claude Code

**In this lesson:** Set up your project folder and learn the build loop.

> **Haven't downloaded the course files yet?** Go back to the [Module Overview](/vibe-coding#download-the-course-materials) to get set up.

## What is Vibecoding?

Vibecoding is building software by describing what you want instead of writing code.

The term was popularized by Andrej Karpathy - the idea of "fully giving in to the vibes." You describe the outcome, AI handles the implementation.

The skill isn't coding. It's:
- Being clear about what you want
- Giving good feedback
- Knowing when something's right

You're orchestrating, not implementing.

## The PM/Engineer Dynamic

This is how non-technical founders actually work with developers:

- **Your job:** Know what you want, give clear feedback
- **Their job:** Figure out how to build it

In this module, you're the PM. Claude is the engineer.

You describe. Claude builds. You review. Claude refines.

This is a real professional skill that transfers everywhere - working with designers, developers, agencies, or any AI tool.

## The Build Loop

Every project follows the same loop:

1. **Plan** → Get clear on what you're building
2. **Build** → Let AI create it
3. **Iterate** → Refine until it's right
4. **Save** → Back it up to GitHub
5. **Go Live** → Put it on the internet (deploy)

This loop works for anything - landing pages, tools, apps, prototypes.

## What is a Framework?

A framework is a pre-built foundation so you don't start from scratch.

Think of it like a house frame before you add walls and paint. It handles common patterns so you can focus on your specific app.

**Next.js** is the framework we use - it's popular for building websites and works seamlessly with Vercel (where we'll deploy).

You don't need to understand it. Just know it exists.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the most popular programming language for websites. It runs in browsers and makes websites interactive.

You don't need to learn it - Claude writes it for you.
