## 4.4: GitHub

- **Time to Complete:** 15 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-4-4` in Claude Code

**In this lesson:** Push your project to a private GitHub repository.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that tracks every change to your files over time.

Think of it like "track changes" in Word, but for entire projects. You can:
- See the history of every change
- Go back to any previous version
- Undo mistakes

It solves the "Final_v3_REAL_FINAL.docx" problem forever.

## Git vs GitHub

These are related but different:

**Git** = The version control system that runs on your computer. It tracks changes locally.

**GitHub** = A website that stores your Git repositories in the cloud.

Analogy: Git is like Microsoft Word (the tool). GitHub is like Google Drive (where you store and share files).

## Key Terms

| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Repository (repo)** | A project folder tracked by Git |
| **Commit** | A saved snapshot at a point in time |
| **Push** | Upload commits from your computer → GitHub |
| **Pull** | Download changes from GitHub → your computer |

## Why You Need This for Deployment

Right now your code only exists on your computer. If your laptop dies, it's gone.

More importantly: deployment services need to pull your code from somewhere. GitHub is that somewhere.

When you deploy in the next lesson, Vercel will connect to your GitHub repo and pull the code automatically.

## What is the GitHub CLI?

The GitHub CLI (`gh`) is a command-line tool for working with GitHub.

Claude uses it so you don't have to type Git commands yourself. It authenticates through your browser using a device code flow - you'll see a code, enter it on GitHub's website, and you're connected.

## Troubleshooting

### "gh: command not found"
GitHub CLI isn't installed.
- **Mac:** Run `brew install gh`
- **Others:** Download from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com)

### Authentication failed
Run `gh auth login` again and make sure you complete the browser step. You need to enter the code and click "Authorize."

### "Repository already exists"
A repo with that name already exists on your GitHub. Either:
- Pick a different name
- Delete the existing repo on github.com first

### "Permission denied"
Your authentication token expired. Re-run `gh auth login`.

### Can't find repo on github.com
Make sure you're logged into the correct GitHub account in your browser.
