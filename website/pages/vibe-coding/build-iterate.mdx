## 4.3: Build & Iterate

- **Time to Complete:** 30-40 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-4-3` in Claude Code

**In this lesson:** Claude scaffolds the project, builds your app, and you iterate with screenshots.

## What is a Development Server?

A development server runs your code locally so you can see it as a website.

Key things to know:
- It only works on YOUR computer (not public)
- It lets you test and iterate before going live
- It must keep running while you're viewing the site
- Stop it with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## What is Localhost?

`localhost` means your own computer acting as a server.

`localhost:3000` = port 3000 on your machine.

This is NOT a real URL. Nobody else can access it. You'll get a real URL when you deploy in lesson 4.5.

## What is Plan Mode?

Plan mode is a Claude Code feature where Claude shows you the plan before executing.

- Toggle it with **Shift+Tab**
- Good for big tasks where you want to review first
- You approve the plan, then Claude builds

For complex builds, this lets you ask questions and make adjustments before any code is written.

## Why Iteration Matters

The first version is never perfect. This is normal and expected.

Professional development is always: build → review → refine → repeat.

The difference with AI: iterations take seconds instead of days. So don't settle - keep refining until you love it.

## The Screenshot Trick

**Ctrl+V** (not Cmd+V on Mac!) pastes images directly into Claude Code.

This is powerful for iteration:
- Take a screenshot of what's wrong
- Circle the problem or point at it
- Paste it and describe what you want different

Visual feedback is faster than describing problems in words.

## Troubleshooting

### "npm: command not found"
Node.js isn't installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), install it, then restart your terminal.

### "Port 3000 already in use"
Another app is using that port. Either:
- Close other terminal windows that might be running servers
- Use a different port (Claude can help with this)

### Browser didn't open
Manually go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Blank page
1. Check your terminal for build errors (red text)
2. Check browser console: press F12, click "Console" tab, look for red errors

### Changes not showing
- Did you refresh the browser?
- Is the dev server still running in the terminal?

### Style looks wrong
Clear browser cache with **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows), or try an incognito window.

**[4.4: GitHub →](/vibe-coding/github)** - Save your code to the cloud so it's backed up and ready for deployment
