## 4.5: Go Live

- **Time to Complete:** 15 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-4-5` in Claude Code

**In this lesson:** Deploy your project and get a live URL to share.

## What is Deployment?

Deployment is taking code from your computer and putting it on the internet.

Your code goes from your machine → servers that anyone can access → real URL.

Developers say "deploy," "ship," or "go live" constantly. This is the moment your thing becomes real.

## What is Hosting?

Hosting means servers that run your code 24/7 and handle traffic from visitors.

You don't manage the servers yourself - the hosting service handles all of that. You just give them your code.

## What is Vercel?

Vercel is a hosting service for websites. It's:
- **Free** for personal projects (generous free tier)
- **Made by the creators of Next.js** - they work perfectly together
- **Connected to GitHub** - auto-deploys when you push changes

Give Vercel your GitHub repo → it builds your code → you get a real URL like `yourproject.vercel.app`.

## How Auto-Deploy Works

This is the magic:

1. You push code to GitHub
2. Vercel detects the change
3. Vercel rebuilds and redeploys automatically
4. Your live site updates in ~1 minute

No manual steps after initial setup. Change code → push → it's live.

## What is the Vercel CLI?

The Vercel CLI is a command-line tool for deploying directly from your terminal.

Claude uses it to deploy without you leaving Claude Code. It authenticates through your browser, similar to GitHub.

## Troubleshooting

### "vercel: command not found"
Vercel CLI isn't installed. Run `npm i -g vercel`

### Authentication failed
Run `vercel login` again and complete the browser authorization.

### Build failed
Check the Vercel dashboard for error logs. Usually it's a code issue - tell Claude what the error says and it can help fix it.

### "Project not found"
Make sure you're in the correct project folder when you run the deploy command.

### Site shows old version
Deployment might still be building. Check the Vercel dashboard for status - it usually takes about a minute.

### Works locally but not on Vercel
Environment differences. Check the Vercel build logs for clues about what's different.

## After Deployment

Once you're live:

1. **Test on your phone** - same URL works on any device
2. **Share with friends** - send the link, watch their reaction
3. **Future updates:** change code → push to GitHub → auto-deploys

That's the whole flow. You now know how to build and ship things.

## The Complete Loop

You've learned:

| Step | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Plan** | Get clear on what you're building |
| **Build** | Let AI create it |
| **Iterate** | Refine until it's right |
| **Save** | Back it up to GitHub |
| **Go Live** | Put it on the internet |

This loop works for any project. Landing pages, tools, apps, prototypes - same process.

## What's Next

**Module 4 Complete!**

You now have the full vibecoding workflow. Try building something else - start a new project folder and follow the same loop. The best way to learn is to make something you actually want.
