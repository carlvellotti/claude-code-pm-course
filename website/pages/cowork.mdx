## What Is Cowork?

> **Lesson 1:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 1"*

**Claude Cowork is Claude Code for non-developers.** Same powerful AI agent, wrapped in an interface that doesn't require a terminal.

You give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, and create files in that folder—organizing downloads, building spreadsheets from receipts, drafting reports from scattered notes, and more.

**The key difference from regular Claude:** Cowork produces actual files, not text you copy-paste. Ask for an expense spreadsheet, get a real `.xlsx` with working formulas. Ask for a presentation, get a real `.pptx` with slides.

### The Metaphor

| Tool | Role | What It Does |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Claude** | Researcher | Answers questions, does research |
| **Claude Code** | CTO | Writes and edits code |
| **Claude Cowork** | COO | Operates your work life—files, documents, research |

Anthropic built Cowork in about 10 days. Using Claude Code.

---

## Requirements & Setup

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Platform** | macOS only (Windows coming soon) |
| **App** | Claude Desktop app |
| **Plan** | Claude Pro ($20/month) |
| **Status** | Research preview |

### Getting Started

1. Download the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Click **"Cowork"** in the sidebar
3. Grant access to a folder
4. Start delegating

**Important:** Start with a dedicated work folder. Don't point Claude at your entire Documents folder on day one.

---

## The Mental Shift

> The biggest mistake people make with Cowork is treating it like ChatGPT with folder access.

**Wrong approach:**
- Ask a question → get an answer → copy-paste into a document

**Right approach:**
- Describe an outcome → step away → come back to finished work

As Anthropic puts it: *"It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker."*

If you keep treating it like a chat interface, you'll get 10% of the value.

---

## The "Done" Framework

> **Lesson 3:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 3"*

The quality of your output is directly proportional to the quality of your input.

Before you delegate anything, answer three questions:

### 1. What does "done" look like?

If you can't picture the finished state, neither can Claude.

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|----------|-------------|
| "Create an expense report" | "Create an Excel spreadsheet with columns for date, vendor, amount, and category, sorted by date, with a sum total at the bottom" |

### 2. What context does Claude need?

- Your naming conventions?
- Your folder structure preferences?
- The difference between work and personal documents?

If you don't tell Claude, it will make assumptions. Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they're not.

### 3. What constraints matter?

- "Don't delete any files, just move them."
- "Keep the original filenames but add a date prefix."
- "Only process files from the last 90 days."

Claude can't read your mind about limits you haven't stated.

**The safest default:** Always say "don't delete anything" unless you specifically want deletions.

---

## Prompt Templates

Copy these. They work.

### File Organization

```
Organize all files in this folder. Group them into subfolders by
[project/client/file type]. Rename each file using the format
YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name. Do not delete anything. Create a
summary document listing what you moved and where.
```

### Research Synthesis

```
Read all the documents in this folder. Create a single report
that synthesizes the key findings. Include direct quotes where
relevant, with the source file name. Flag any contradictions
between sources. End with a list of questions that remain
unanswered.
```

### Document Creation

```
Create a [PowerPoint/Word doc/Excel spreadsheet] based on the
files in this folder. Use [specific structure or template].
The audience is [who]. The goal is [what you want them to
understand or do after reading].
```

### Data Extraction

```
I have [X] screenshots of [receipts/invoices/forms] in this
folder. Extract the data into an Excel spreadsheet with columns
for [list columns]. Sort by [column]. Add a total row at the
bottom. Flag any images that were unclear or couldn't be processed.
```

---

## Folder Setup

> **Lesson 5:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 5"*

Don't give Claude access to random folders. Create a system.

### Recommended Structure

```
Claude-Work/
├── inbox/          ← Drop files here for Claude to process
├── processed/      ← Claude moves finished work here
├── outputs/        ← Claude creates new files here
└── reference/      ← Files Claude should read but not modify
```

### Tell Claude About It

Include this in your first prompt:

```
The inbox folder contains files to process. Move them to
processed when done. Create any new files in outputs. The
reference folder is read-only—don't modify those files.
```

This creates a repeatable workflow. Drop files in inbox, tell Claude to process, find results in outputs.

---

## File Operations

> **Lessons 2 & 4:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 2"*

This is Cowork's superpower: **content-aware file organization**.

### What Makes It Different

Regular file organization looks at filenames. `IMG_4521.png` goes in "Images."

Cowork looks at **contents**. That `IMG_4521.png`? Claude can see it's actually a receipt from a coffee supplier. It goes in "Receipts/Coffee-Suppliers."

### Scale

People have organized 300+ files in minutes. Downloads folders with years of chaos—sorted by actually reading what each file contains.

### The Pattern

1. Point Claude at a messy folder
2. Give a clear delegation with the Done framework
3. Request a change log so you can review decisions
4. Let it run

### Example Delegation

```
Organize all files in this folder into logical categories based
on their contents. Rename files with YYYY-MM-DD prefix where
dates are identifiable. Create subfolders that make sense.
Document every decision in ORGANIZATION-LOG.md showing
before/after for each file. Don't delete anything.
```

---

## Research & Synthesis

> **Lesson 6:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 6"*

This is where Cowork saves hours.

### The Problem

You have 20 documents—customer interviews, survey results, support tickets. You need patterns and insights.

Manually: Read each document, take notes, cross-reference, write up findings. Hours of work.

### The Cowork Approach

Claude reads all documents simultaneously and synthesizes across them—not just summarizing each one, but connecting dots between them.

Customer A said one thing. Customer B said something related. Customer C contradicted both. Claude catches all of it and cites sources.

### What to Ask For

```
Read all documents in this folder. Create a synthesis report with:
- Executive summary
- Key themes (with supporting quotes and source files cited)
- Contradictions between sources
- Patterns by [segment/category/source type]
- Specific [requests/recommendations/insights] mentioned
- Questions that remain unanswered
```

### What This Works For

- Customer feedback synthesis
- Competitive research
- Literature reviews
- Meeting notes across multiple meetings
- Interview transcripts
- Any multi-source analysis

---

## Document Creation

> **Lesson 8:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 8"*

Cowork produces **actual files**, not text you copy-paste.

### What Each Format Does

| Format | Capabilities |
|--------|--------------|
| **Excel (.xlsx)** | Working formulas (SUM, VLOOKUP, IF), conditional formatting, multiple sheets, charts, data validation |
| **PowerPoint (.pptx)** | Real slides with layouts, speaker notes, logical flow—not just bullet points |
| **Word (.docx)** | Proper headings, tables of contents, formatted tables |
| **PDF** | Form filling, document assembly |

### Example: Receipt → Expense Tracker

```
I have receipt photos in this folder. Create expense-tracker.xlsx with:
- Data sheet: Date, Vendor, Category, Amount, Payment Method
- Formulas for totals by category
- Conditional formatting for expenses over $100
- Summary sheet with a chart
- Flagged items sheet for unclear receipts
```

You get a real Excel file. Open it, edit it, share it.

---

## Sub-Agents

> **Lesson 7:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 7"*

When a task has independent parts, Claude spins up multiple workers to tackle them simultaneously.

### How It Works

Instead of processing 10 files sequentially (50 minutes), Claude processes all 10 in parallel (5 minutes), then synthesizes results.

### When to Explicitly Request Them

| Pattern | Example Prompt |
|---------|----------------|
| **Vendor analysis** | "Spin up sub-agents to research each of these four vendors independently. Then synthesize into a comparison." |
| **Multi-perspective** | "Analyze this decision using three sub-agents: financial impact, customer experience, operational risk. Synthesize findings." |
| **Large document sets** | "Use sub-agents to process these 50 transcripts in parallel. Extract themes, then synthesize into one report." |

### What Each Sub-Agent Has

| ✅ Has | ❌ Doesn't Have |
|--------|-----------------|
| Full file system access | Communication with other agents |
| All Claude capabilities | Shared state during processing |
| Independent context | Knowledge of other agents' work (until synthesis) |

---

## Browser Automation

> **Lesson 9:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 9"*

With the **Claude in Chrome** extension, Cowork can control your browser.

### What Works Well

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Competitive research** | Visit pricing pages, extract tiers and features, create comparison spreadsheet |
| **Data extraction** | Pull data from dashboards you're logged into |
| **Public data gathering** | Find SEC filings, extract financials, create comparison table |

### The Honest Truth

Browser automation is **hit or miss**. Pages load weird. Elements don't respond. Sites block automation.

It works great sometimes. Gets stuck other times. If Claude gets stuck, tell it to try again or skip that part.

### Safety Warning

Browser access introduces prompt injection risks. Malicious sites could try to manipulate Claude's behavior.

**Rules:**
- Stick to trusted sites
- Don't send Claude to random URLs
- Claude will ask before submitting forms or taking irreversible actions

---

## Skills System

> **Lessons 5 & 11:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 5"*

Skills are reusable instruction sets that Claude follows.

### What Skills Do

Instead of re-explaining your preferences every session, create a skill once and reference it forever.

### Creating a Custom Skill

Put a markdown file in your work folder:

```markdown
# My Report Style Guide

## Format
- Always use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Include executive summary at top
- End with "Next Steps" section

## Voice
- Professional but not stiff
- No jargon without explanation
- Active voice

## Structure for Status Reports
1. Summary (3 bullets max)
2. Completed This Week
3. In Progress
4. Blockers
5. Next Week
```

Then tell Claude: *"Read style-guide.md and follow it for all documents you create."*

### Built-in Skills

Cowork comes with skills for Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and PDF creation. These load automatically when you ask for those file types.

---

## The AI Employee Pattern

> **Lesson 10:** Tell Claude *"Read START-HERE.md and start lesson 10"*

This is the mindset that unlocks Cowork's full value.

### The Old Way (Chatbot Thinking)

```
Give task → Wait → Get result → Give next task → Wait → Get result
```

### The AI Employee Way

```
Brain dump all tasks → Hand them off → Do something else → Come back to finished work
```

### Batching Strategy

Instead of three separate sessions:

```
"Organize my receipts" → wait → done
"Create expense report" → wait → done
"Summarize for my accountant" → wait → done
```

Do this—one session, one prompt:

```
I have receipt screenshots in /receipts. First, organize them
by month into subfolders. Then create an expense spreadsheet
with all the data. Finally, create a one-page summary for my
accountant showing totals by category. Put all outputs in /outputs.
```

One session. Three tasks. Less usage. Better results.

### The Daily Workflow

1. **Morning:** Brain dump tasks for the day
2. **Hand off:** Give them to Cowork
3. **Work:** Do deep work, meetings, whatever
4. **Check in:** Review outputs, give feedback
5. **Iterate:** "Change this, add that, redo this part"

---

## Cowork vs Claude Code

| Aspect | Claude Code | Cowork |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Interface** | Terminal | GUI |
| **Primary use** | Code/development | Everything else |
| **User** | Developers | Everyone |
| **File access** | Working directory | Folder selection |
| **Learning curve** | Higher | Lower |
| **Customization** | CLAUDE.md, slash commands | Skills |
| **Sandboxing** | Less isolated | Linux VM |

**Use Claude Code when:** You're writing code, working in a codebase, need terminal access.

**Use Cowork when:** You're doing knowledge work, organizing files, creating documents, doing research.

---

## Limitations

Cowork is a research preview. Current limitations:

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Mac only** | Windows coming soon |
| **One folder at a time** | Can't access multiple locations simultaneously |
| **No Projects** | Unlike Claude chat, no saved project contexts |
| **No memory across sessions** | Starts fresh each time |
| **No session sharing** | Can't share with others |
| **No cross-device sync** | Local to your machine |
| **Connectors unreliable** | File system + Chrome + web search work best. Gmail, Calendar, etc. are hit or miss. |

### What Doesn't Work Well

- YouTube transcript fetching (via browser)
- Complex multi-step browser workflows
- Anything requiring reliable external service connectors

Use the feedback button in the app. Anthropic is actively developing based on user reports.

## Safety Checklist

### Before Your First Session

- [ ] Create a dedicated work folder (not Documents or Desktop)
- [ ] Back up any important files you'll give Claude access to
- [ ] Decide what Claude is NOT allowed to delete

### Every Session

- [ ] Be explicit about constraints in your prompt
- [ ] Avoid putting sensitive files in the work folder (credentials, financial docs, personal records)
- [ ] If using browser access, stick to trusted sites

### If Something Seems Off

- [ ] Stop the task immediately
- [ ] Check what files were modified
- [ ] Look for unexpected behavior

### The Golden Rule

**Always say "don't delete anything" unless you specifically want deletions.** Claude only deletes when instructed, but be explicit.

---

## Quick Reference

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Access** | Claude Pro ($20/mo), macOS Desktop app |
| **Get started** | Download app → Click "Cowork" → Grant folder access |
| **Best for** | File organization, research synthesis, document creation, multi-step tasks |
| **Not for** | Quick questions, simple analysis, anything not needing file access |
| **Key capabilities** | Sub-agents, Skills (xlsx/pptx/docx), Chrome browser, web search |
| **Safety basics** | Start narrow, backup files, be explicit about constraints |

---

## TL;DR

1. **Cowork is a worker, not a chatbot.** Delegate outcomes, step away, come back to finished files.

2. **Write better prompts.** Define what "done" looks like, give context, specify constraints.

3. **Start with a dedicated folder.** Limit access while learning. Keep backups.

4. **Use sub-agents for complex work.** Claude parallelizes automatically when helpful.

5. **Skills produce real files.** Excel with formulas, PowerPoint presentations, formatted documents.

6. **Queue tasks and batch related work** to save usage.

7. **Safety is your responsibility.** Backup files, avoid sensitive data, monitor what Claude does.

**The tool is early. Start learning now.**
