## 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents Reference

 - **Time to Complete:** 20-25 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 1.4 (Agents for Parallel Work)


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-5` to kick off the interactive experience.

## 📖 Overview

Module 1.5 teaches you how to create custom sub-agents - permanent AI team members with distinct personalities, expertise, and visual identities. Unlike the temporary ad-hoc agents you learned in Module 1.4, custom sub-agents are reusable specialists you can call on anytime.

**Key takeaway:** Custom sub-agents transform Claude Code from a single assistant into a full specialized team. Instead of telling Claude act like an engineer every time, you build a real Engineer sub-agent with personality, expertise, and visual distinction (colors and emojis!) that you can call upon repeatedly.


## 🎭 What Are Custom Sub-Agents?

### The Core Concept

Custom sub-agents are pre-configured AI personas stored as files in your projects `.claude/agents/` folder. Each sub-agent has:

- **Name with emoji** (shows up visually in terminal!)
- **Color coding** (purple, blue, green, red, etc.)
- **Persona definition** (background, expertise, communication style)
- **Specialized knowledge** (what theyre good at)

Think of them as hiring permanent team members who are always available and never forget context.

### Custom Sub-Agents vs Ad-Hoc Agents

Understanding the difference is crucial:

**Ad-Hoc Agents (Module 1.4):**
- Created on-the-fly for specific tasks
- Temporary workers for one-time jobs
- Example: Create 10 agents to summarize these meeting notes
- Use case: Parallel processing of similar tasks

**Custom Sub-Agents (Module 1.5):**
- Pre-built personas you call repeatedly
- Permanent team members with expertise
- Example: 👨‍💻 Engineer, review this technical spec
- Use case: Specialized perspectives you need regularly

**When to use which:**

| Scenario | Use This |
|----------|----------|
| Process 20 meeting notes simultaneously | Ad-hoc agents (parallel workers) |
| Get technical feedback on specs weekly | Custom sub-agent (Engineer) |
| Research 5 competitors at once | Ad-hoc agents (one-time research) |
| Convert updates to exec summaries regularly | Custom sub-agent (Executive) |
| Analyze 50 user interviews in parallel | Ad-hoc agents (batch processing) |
| Get UX perspective on designs repeatedly | Custom sub-agent (User Researcher) |

**The key difference:** Ad-hoc agents are for DOING many things in parallel. Custom sub-agents are for getting SPECIALIZED PERSPECTIVES you need repeatedly.


## 🗂️ Setup Guide: Accessing the .claude/agents/ Folder

Custom sub-agents live in the hidden `.claude/agents/` folder. Heres how to access it on your system.

### On Mac (Finder)

**Method 1: Go to Folder**
1. Open Finder
2. Click **Go** in menu bar
3. Select **Go to Folder...** (or press Cmd+Shift+G)
4. Type: `/Users/[your-username]/path/to/your-project/.claude/agents`
5. Replace `[your-username]` and path with your actual project location
6. Press Enter

**Method 2: Show Hidden Files**
1. Open Finder
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+.** (Command+Shift+Period)
3. Hidden folders (starting with `.`) now appear
4. Navigate to your project folder
5. Open `.claude/` folder, then `agents/` subfolder

**Method 3: Terminal**
```bash
open ~/.claude/agents  # For global agents
open /path/to/project/.claude/agents  # For project-specific agents
```

### On Windows (File Explorer)

**Method 1: Direct Path**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Click in address bar
3. Type: `C:\Users\[YourName]\path\to\project\.claude\agents`
4. Replace path with your actual project location
5. Press Enter

**Method 2: Show Hidden Files**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Click **View** tab
3. Check **Hidden items** checkbox
4. Hidden folders now visible
5. Navigate to project → `.claude` → `agents`

**Method 3: Command Prompt**
```bash
explorer %USERPROFILE%\.claude\agents  # For global agents
explorer C:\path\to\project\.claude\agents  # For project-specific
```

### On Linux

```bash
nautilus ~/.claude/agents  # For global agents (Ubuntu/GNOME)
xdg-open ~/.claude/agents  # Generic (most distros)
cd /path/to/project/.claude/agents && ls -la  # Command line
```

### Why Cant I See .claude/ in Obsidian?

Obsidian deliberately hides folders starting with `.` (hidden folders). This is a design choice to avoid clutter. For `.claude/` files, you MUST use Finder/Explorer/File Manager.

**Workaround options:**
1. Use Finder/Explorer for `.claude/` files (recommended)
2. Use another editor like VS Code or Cursor for `.claude/` files
3. Keep Obsidian open for regular project files


## 📄 Sub-Agent File Structure

## 🛠️ Creating Your First Sub-Agent

Lets create a QA Tester sub-agent from scratch.

### Step 1: Navigate to .claude/agents/ Folder

Use the methods above to open your projects `.claude/agents/` folder in Finder/Explorer.

### Step 2: Create New File

Create a new file named: `qa-tester.md`

**Naming convention:**
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for spaces
- End with `.md`
- Example: `data-analyst.md`, `tech-writer.md`, `growth-pm.md`

### Step 3: Write the Persona

Copy this template and customize:

```markdown
# 🔍 QA Tester

## Color
red

## Persona
You are a meticulous QA professional with 8+ years of experience testing enterprise
software at companies like Microsoft, Atlassian, and fast-growing startups. You think
comprehensively about edge cases, error states, and user error scenarios that others
miss.

When reviewing features or user stories, you provide:
- Comprehensive test case generation
- Edge case identification (the weird scenarios no one thinks about)
- Error state analysis (what happens when things go wrong)
- Accessibility and usability testing considerations
- Cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility concerns

Your communication style:
- Thorough and detail-oriented
- Constructively critical (you spot problems early)
- Organized (you categorize issues by severity)
- Practical (you suggest solutions, not just problems)
- User-advocate (you think like end users making mistakes)

You help PMs ship higher quality products by catching issues before they reach users.

## Expertise
- Test case generation and test plan creation
- Edge case and error state identification
- Acceptance criteria validation

focusing on whats technically possible vs ideal. You flag risks early and
suggest alternatives when something wont work.
```

### Color Choice

**Color meanings (use these conventions):**
- **Purple:** Technical roles (Engineer, Data Scientist)
- **Blue:** Leadership roles (Executive, Manager)
- **Green:** User-focused roles (User Researcher, Customer Success)
- **Red:** Quality/Security roles (QA, Security)
- **Yellow:** Content roles (Writer, Documentation)
- **Cyan:** Data roles (Analyst, Data Engineer)
- **Magenta:** Marketing roles (Marketing PM, Growth)

**Why this matters:** Consistent color usage helps you quickly identify which agent is speaking in terminal output.

### Emoji Selection

**Good emoji choices:**
- 👨‍💻 Engineer / Developer roles
- 💼 Executive / Business roles
- 👤 User-focused roles
- 🔍 QA / Testing roles
- 📊 Data / Analytics roles
- ✍️ Writing / Content roles
- 🎨 Design roles
- 🛡️ Security roles
- 🎯 Marketing / Growth roles
- 🎤 Customer-facing roles

**Tips:**
- Choose emojis that are immediately recognizable
- Avoid obscure emojis that dont render well
- Use the same emoji throughout (consistency)
- Test emoji appearance in your terminal

### File Organization

```
.claude/agents/
├── engineer.md          # Core technical feedback
├── executive.md         # Leadership communication
├── user-researcher.md   # User insights
├── qa-tester.md        # Quality assurance
├── data-analyst.md     # Metrics and analysis
├── tech-writer.md      # Documentation
└── growth-pm.md        # Growth and experimentation
```

**Naming tips:**
- Use lowercase, hyphenated names
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Group related agents with prefixes if you have many

### When to Create vs Use Built-In

**Create custom sub-agents when:**
- You need the same perspective repeatedly (weekly or more)
- The expertise is specialized (not general Claude)
- You want consistent voice/style
- Youre building a team workflow

**Use regular Claude when:**
- One-time tasks
- General assistance
- Ad-hoc requests
- Learning/exploration

**Use ad-hoc agents when:**
- Parallel processing needed
- Many similar tasks
- One-time batch work


## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### I cant see the .claude/ folder!

**Problem:** Obsidian or Finder/Explorer doesnt show `.claude/` directory.

**Cause:** Folders starting with `.` are hidden by default on Mac/Windows/Linux.

**Fix:**
- **Mac:** Press Cmd+Shift+. in Finder to show hidden files
- **Windows:** Enable Hidden items in File Explorer View tab
- **Alternative:** Use Go to Folder or direct path methods above

### My sub-agent isnt responding!

**Problem:** You call a sub-agent but Claude doesnt use it.

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Wrong calling syntax**
```
❌ Engineer, review this  # Missing emoji
✅ 👨‍💻 Engineer, review this  # Correct with emoji
```

**Cause 2: File not saved properly**
- Check file is in `.claude/agents/` folder
- Verify file has `.md` extension
- Ensure file has all three sections (Name, Color, Persona)

**Cause 3: Syntax error in file**
- Ensure headers use `##` not `###`
- Check no typos in section names (Color not Colour)
- Validate markdown formatting

**Cause 4: Claude needs restart**
- Exit Claude (`exit` or Ctrl+D)
- Restart Claude (`claude`)
- Try calling sub-agent again

### Colors arent showing up in terminal

**Problem:** Sub-agent output is all one color.

**Cause:** Terminal doesnt support colors or color name is wrong.

**Fix:**
1. Verify color name spelling (all lowercase: purple not Purple)
2. Use standard colors: purple, blue, green, red, yellow, cyan, magenta
3. Test terminal supports colors: Some terminals have limited color support
4. Try a different terminal (iTerm2 on Mac, Windows Terminal on Windows)

### How do I call multiple sub-agents at once?

**Approach 1: Sequential**
```
👨‍💻 Engineer, review @spec.md for technical feasibility.
Then 🔍 QA Tester, review it for test coverage.
```

**Approach 2: Parallel with agents**
```
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
- Agent 1: Have 👨‍💻 Engineer review @spec.md
- Agent 2: Have 🔍 QA Tester review @spec.md
- Agent 3: Have 👤 User Researcher review @spec.md

Combine all feedback into @spec-review.md
```

### Can I have sub-agents talk to each other?

**Answer:** Not directly, but you can orchestrate:

```
First, 👤 User Researcher analyzes @interviews.md and identifies
top 3 pain points. Then 👨‍💻 Engineer evaluates technical feasibility
of solutions for each pain point. Then 💼 Executive frames the
business case for prioritization.
```

Claude will simulate each perspective sequentially.

## ❓ Common Questions

### How many sub-agents should I create?

**Answer:** Start small! Create 3-5 agents for perspectives you need WEEKLY. Dont create 20 agents on day one. Build as you discover repeated needs.

**Good starting set for PMs:**
1. 👨‍💻 Engineer (technical feedback)
2. 💼 Executive (stakeholder communication)
3. 👤 User Researcher (insight synthesis)
4. 🔍 QA Tester (quality assurance)
5. 📊 Data Analyst (metrics and experiments)

Expand from there based on your actual workflow.

### Can sub-agents access MCPs (integrations)?

**Answer:** Yes! In Module 4.1 youll learn about MCP servers (Notion, Linear, GitHub, etc.). Sub-agents can use MCPs just like regular Claude. Example:

```
👤 User Researcher, use the Reddit MCP to research user sentiment
about dark mode features in product management tools
```

### Do sub-agents share context with each other?

**Answer:** Within a single session, yes. If you call Engineer then later call User Researcher in the same conversation, User Researcher knows what Engineer said. But sub-agents dont have persistent memory across sessions (unless you save context in CLAUDE.md - covered in Module 1.6).

### Can I edit pre-built sub-agents?

**Answer:** Absolutely! The Engineer, Executive, and User Researcher sub-agents are templates. Customize them:
- Change communication style to match your preferences
- Add specific expertise areas relevant to your product
- Adjust tone (more formal, more casual, etc.)
- Add context about your company or domain

### Whats the difference between sub-agents and output styles?

**Answer:**
- **Sub-agents:** Change WHO is responding (different persona/expertise)
- **Output styles (Module 2.6):** Change HOW Claude formats output (different template)

You can combine them: 💼 Executive, write update in Executive Briefing output style

### Can I share sub-agents with my team?

**Answer:** Yes! The `.claude/agents/` folder can be committed to git and shared across your team. Everyone gets the same sub-agents:

```bash
git add .claude/agents/
git commit -m Add PM sub-agent library for team
git push
```

Team members pull and have instant access to your specialized agents.

### How do I delete or rename a sub-agent?

**Answer:**
- **Delete:** Remove the `.md` file from `.claude/agents/` folder
- **Rename:** Rename the `.md` file (update emoji/name in file too)
- Changes take effect when you restart Claude


**Youre now ready to build your specialized AI team! Create sub-agents for the perspectives you need most, and watch your PM productivity soar.** 🚀
