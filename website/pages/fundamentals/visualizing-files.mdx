## 1.2: Visualizing Your Workspace

 - **Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 1.1 complete, basic familiarity with file systems


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-2` to kick off the interactive experience.

## Overview

Set up a visual workspace to see your project files in real-time alongside Claude Code for a seamless split-screen workflow.

**Key takeaway:** A visual workspace lets you watch files appear and update as Claude works.


## Why Visualization Matters

Working with Claude Code in a terminal feels like working blind. You ask Claude to create documents, but you can't see what's happening.

**The solution:** Open a visual editor alongside your terminal. Now you can:
- Watch files appear as Claude creates them
- Read documents while Claude is working
- Verify everything is organized correctly
- Always know exactly what's happening

This transforms Claude Code from a mysterious black box into a transparent tool you can watch and verify in real-time.


## Choose Your Tool

### Nimbalyst (Recommended)

**Best for:** Claude Code users who want the smoothest experience

![Nimbalyst - Visual workspace for Claude Code](/images/nimbalyst-hero.webp)

[Nimbalyst](https://nimbalyst.com/for-product-managers?ref=carlvellotti&utm_source=carlvellotti&utm_medium=ccforpms&utm_campaign=partner) is a free, purpose-built wrapper for Claude Code with:
- **WYSIWYG markdown editing** - See formatted text, not raw markdown syntax
- **File diffs** - See exactly what Claude changed when editing files
- **Hidden folder visibility** - Can see the `.claude/` folder (unlike Obsidian)
- **Session management** - Manage multiple Claude Code sessions
- **Integrated with Claude Code** - Edit your markdown and work with Claude Code all in one tool without switching to the command line

**Download:** https://nimbalyst.com/for-product-managers?ref=carlvellotti&utm_source=carlvellotti&utm_medium=ccforpms&utm_campaign=partner

### Obsidian

**Best for:** Users who want a standalone note-taking app

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a free, popular markdown editor with:
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Wikilinks (`[[filename]]`) for connecting notes
- Graph view to visualize note connections
- Large plugin ecosystem

**Limitations:**
- Cannot display hidden folders like `.claude/` - you'll use Finder/Explorer for those
- Requires you work in 2 tools, Obsidian for markdown file editing and the terminal for Claude Code

**Download:** https://obsidian.md/download

### VS Code / Cursor

**Best for:** Users who already use these tools or want code editing capabilities

- Full-featured code editors
- Can show hidden folders
- Extensions for markdown preview
- More complex than needed for pure PM work


## Setup Guide

### Nimbalyst Setup

1. **Download:** Visit https://nimbalyst.com/for-product-managers?ref=carlvellotti&utm_source=carlvellotti&utm_medium=ccforpms&utm_campaign=partner and click download
2. **Install:** Run the installer for your OS
3. **Open project:** Open your course folder in Nimbalyst
4. **Split-screen:** Position Claude Code terminal and Nimbalyst side-by-side

### Obsidian Setup

1. **Download:** Visit https://obsidian.md/download (free for personal use)
2. **Open your project:** Select "Open folder as vault" and navigate to your course folder
3. **Split-screen:** Position Claude Code terminal and Obsidian side-by-side

**Note:** Ask Claude for the exact path if needed: `What's the path to my course folder?`


## The .claude/ Folder

The `.claude/` folder contains agents, commands, and settings. Access depends on your tool:

| Tool | Can see .claude/? | How to access |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Nimbalyst** | Yes | Visible in file browser |
| **Obsidian** | No | Use Finder/Explorer |
| **VS Code** | Yes | Enable hidden files |

**To view `.claude/` in Finder/Explorer:**
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Shift + .` in Finder to show hidden folders
- **Windows:** Enable "Hidden items" in File Explorer View tab

**When you need it:** Module 1.5 (Custom Sub-Agents) and later. For now, focus on regular project files.

**Note:** Claude Code can always access `.claude/` files regardless of your editor.


## Real-Time Visualization Demo

When Claude creates or edits files, you'll watch them appear in your editor instantly.

**Try it:**

1. Open your editor with your project folder
2. In Claude Code, ask: *Create a file called test-visualization.md with some content*
3. Watch your editor - the file appears immediately
4. Click it to read what Claude wrote

That's it! No refresh needed. Files update in real-time as Claude works.


## Editor Tips

### Nimbalyst Tips
- Watch for highlighted diffs when Claude edits files
- The `.claude/` folder is visible for building custom agents later

### Obsidian Tips

**Essential shortcuts:**
- **`Cmd/Ctrl + O`** - Quick Switcher (jump to any file)
- **`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F`** - Search across all files
- **`Cmd/Ctrl + E`** - Toggle Reading/Editing view

**Wikilinks:** Connect documents with `[[filename]]` syntax for easy navigation

**Tags:** Organize with `#prd #user-research #q1-2025` for filtering

**Stay in Reading view** for cleaner formatted display

### VS Code Tips
- **`Cmd/Ctrl + P`** - Quick open any file
- Enable hidden files to see `.claude/`


## Example: Real-Time Workflow

**Without visualization:** Claude creates files, but you're unsure what happened or where they are.

**With a visual workspace:** Watch files appear instantly, click to review content, verify organization - complete visibility and control.


## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use split-screen workflow constantly
- Use quick-open shortcuts to navigate
- Keep your editor focused on the project folder

**Don't:**
- Work full-screen terminal only (you're missing half the value)
- Worry about mastering your editor right now (just use it as a file viewer)


## Troubleshooting

### I don't see any files

**Likely cause:** Wrong folder opened

**Fix:**
1. Ask Claude: `What's the path to my course folder?`
2. Re-open that exact folder in your editor
3. Your files should now appear

**Common mistake:** Opening a parent folder instead of the project folder itself

**Example:**
- Wrong: `/Users/yourname/Documents` (too high level)
- Correct: `/Users/yourname/Documents/claude-code-pm-course`

### Files aren't updating

**Likely cause:** Editor needs to detect the change

**Fix:**
1. Click outside and back into editor window (forces refresh)
2. Or: Close and reopen the specific file
3. Or: Restart the editor (rare, but works)

### I see raw markdown instead of formatted text

**For Obsidian:** Press `Cmd/Ctrl + E` to toggle to Reading view, or click the book icon

**For Nimbalyst:** Content should display formatted by default (WYSIWYG)

### Where's the .claude/ folder?

**Nimbalyst:** Should be visible in the file browser

**Obsidian:** Hidden by design. Use Finder/Explorer:
- **Mac:** Open Finder → Navigate to project → Press `Cmd + Shift + .`
- **Windows:** Open File Explorer → Navigate to project → View tab → Check "Hidden items"
