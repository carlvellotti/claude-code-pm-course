## 2.3: Product Strategy

 - **Time to Complete:** 60-90 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 1.4 (Task Orchestration), Module 1.5 (Custom Sub-Agents)


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-2-3` to kick off the interactive experience.

## Overview

Module 2.3 teaches you to develop product strategy using AI as a thinking partner. You'll use Rumelt's Strategy Kernel framework (Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions) to structure strategic thinking, pressure-test choices with devil's advocate, and transform strategy documents into executive presentations.

**Key takeaway:** AI can't make strategic decisions for you, but it can help you research faster, apply frameworks rigorously, challenge assumptions, and communicate clearly.


## What is Product Strategy?

Product strategy is a set of **hard choices** about where to focus resources and how to create competitive advantage.

### Strategy vs. Not Strategy

| Not Strategy | Real Strategy |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Increase revenue 50%" (goal) | "Focus exclusively on voice-first AI for SMBs, explicitly NOT competing on breadth against Notion" (clear choices + tradeoffs) |
| "Build AI chat, voice, automation" (features) | "Go deep on one capability where we can uniquely win with limited resources" (focused direction) |
| "Be the best productivity tool" (vision) | "Subsidize AI costs initially to build defensibility through usage data and retention" (positioning) |

### AI's Role in Strategy

| AI Can't Do | AI Can Do |
|-------------|-----------|
| Make tradeoffs (requires judgment) | Research competitors in parallel |
| Provide deep context about your market | Apply frameworks rigorously |
| Commit to hard choices | Challenge assumptions (devil's advocate) |
| | Synthesize documents and create presentations |


## Rumelt's Strategy Kernel Framework

### The Three-Part Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         1. DIAGNOSIS                    │
│    What's the challenge/opportunity?    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       2. GUIDING POLICY                 │

│   (Initiatives that reinforce each      │
│    other and align with the policy)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Diagnosis

A clear, actionable statement of the strategic challenge or opportunity based on real data.

**Good diagnosis:**
> The AI landscape is heating up fast. Notion, Linear, and Asana have all launched AI features in the past 6 months. As a smaller player with a 2-person AI team and limited budget (~$50k/quarter), we can't compete on breadth. We need to find a defensible position where we can uniquely win with limited resources.

**Bad diagnosis:**
> Competitors are doing AI (too vague, no insight)

### 2. Guiding Policy

Your overall approach that makes **explicit tradeoffs** about where to compete and how to win.

**Good guiding policy:**
> We'll focus exclusively on voice-first AI for SMBs (5-20 person teams), explicitly NOT competing on breadth against larger players. We'll differentiate through AI features that small teams need but enterprise-focused competitors won't build. We'll subsidize AI costs in our base pricing to drive adoption, accepting lower margins initially to build defensibility through usage data and retention.

**Bad guiding policy:**
> We'll build great AI features and win in the market (no choices, no tradeoffs)

### 3. Coherent Actions

Specific, coordinated initiatives that implement your guiding policy and reinforce each other.

**Good coherent actions:**
```
Q1 2026:
- Expand voice to meeting notes + task breakdown (deepening voice capability)
- Launch SMB-specific templates (5-20 person team workflows)
- A/B test AI in base price vs. premium tier

Q2 2026:
- Voice collaboration features (multi-user voice sessions)
- SMB admin dashboard (usage tracking for small team leads)
- Refine pricing based on Q1 data
```


## The Strategy Development Workflow

```
1. COMPETITIVE RESEARCH
   ↓ (Use parallel agents with WebSearch)

2. STRATEGIC CHOICES
   ↓ (Make 5 key tradeoff decisions)

3. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
   ↓ (Pressure-test each choice)

4. SYNTHESIS
   ↓ (AI creates strategy doc using Rumelt's Kernel)

5. PRESENTATION
   ↓ (Use pptx skill for executive slides)
```

### 1. Competitive Research with Parallel Agents

Launch multiple agents in parallel to research different competitors simultaneously.

```markdown
Spin up 3 agents to research the competitive AI landscape:
- Agent 1: Research Notion's AI features, pricing, and positioning
- Agent 2: Research Linear's AI features, pricing, and positioning
- Agent 3: Research Asana's AI features, pricing, and positioning

For each competitor, I need:
- What AI features they've launched
- How they position and price AI
- What seems to be working vs. not working
- Where there might be whitespace for us
```

**Why parallel agents work:** 3x faster than sequential research, each agent uses WebSearch for latest information.

### 2. Making Strategic Choices

Answer 5 multiple-choice questions that force real tradeoffs:

| Choice | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **#1: Focus vs Breadth** | A) Go deep on one capability<br/>B) Spread AI across all features<br/>C) Partner for capabilities |
| **#2: Competitive Response** | A) Race to out-innovate<br/>B) Differentiate differently<br/>C) Ignore and focus on roadmap |
| **#3: Business Model** | A) Premium AI tier (margins over adoption)<br/>B) Subsidize to drive adoption<br/>C) Usage-based pricing |
| **#4: Product Scope** | A) AI as the product<br/>B) AI as enhancement<br/>C) AI for specific jobs |
| **#5: Risk Tolerance** | A) Move fast, take risks<br/>B) Deliberate and defensible<br/>C) Wait and learn |

Your 5 answers become your Guiding Policy.

### 3. Devil's Advocate - Pressure-Testing Choices

After each choice, use AI to challenge your thinking:

```markdown
User chooses: A) Go deep on voice

Devil's advocate response:
You're betting everything on voice. But what if voice becomes
commoditized in 6 months? OpenAI just released better voice
recognition at 1/10th the cost. If everyone has voice, you've
built your strategy on something that's no longer differentiated.
With a 2-person team, you won't have resources to pivot.
Isn't this risky?

User then: Stick with choice OR Reconsider
```

**Why this works:** Forces you to think through downsides BEFORE committing. Better to hear hard questions from AI than from your CEO.

### 4. Synthesizing Strategy Documents

Once you've made your 5 strategic choices, AI synthesizes them into a complete strategy document using Rumelt's Kernel:

**AI takes:**
- Competitive research → Diagnosis
- Your 5 choices → Guiding Policy
- Creates 6-month roadmap aligned with choices → Coherent Actions

**You provide:**
- The strategic choices (AI can't make these)
- Context about constraints and situation
- Judgment about which devil's advocate challenges matter

**Output structure:**

```markdown
# H1 2026 AI Product Strategy

## DIAGNOSIS: The Strategic Challenge
[Competitive landscape + your constraints → core challenge]

## GUIDING POLICY: Our Strategic Approach
[Your 5 choices synthesized into coherent direction]
[Explicit tradeoffs - what we're NOT doing]

## COHERENT ACTIONS: H1 2026 Roadmap

### Q1 2026
- Initiative 1 (aligned with choices)
- Initiative 2 (aligned with choices)

### Q2 2026
- Initiative 3 (builds on Q1)

### Success Metrics
- Metric 1: [Target]

## CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS
- Assumption 1: [What needs to be true]

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
- Why customers choose us vs. alternatives
- Risks and mitigation
```

### 5. Creating Executive Presentations with Skills

Transform your strategy document into presentation slides using the pptx skill:

```markdown
Use the pptx skill to create an executive presentation from
my strategy document.

Requirements:
- 12-15 slides covering complete strategy
- Include: Title, Executive Summary, Diagnosis, Competitive
  Landscape, Strategic Direction, Tradeoffs, Roadmap (Q1/Q2),
  Success Metrics, Critical Assumptions, Why We'll Win, Risks
- Professional design for executive audience
- Save as strategy-review-slides.pptx
```

**Note:** The pptx skill requires `python-pptx` library. If installation fails, you can create a markdown outline of slides instead.


## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** You're the Gen AI PM at TaskFlow. You shipped AI voice chat for todos (well-received, moderate usage). Leadership asks: How should we evolve our AI strategy for H1 2026?

**Approach:**

**1. Research competitors in parallel:**
```markdown
Spin up 3 agents to research:
- Notion AI (positioning, features, pricing)
- Linear AI (engineering-focused features)
- Asana AI (enterprise focus, strategic direction)
```

**2. Identify diagnosis:**
Based on competitive research + constraints (2-person AI team, ~$50k/quarter budget):
> We can't compete on breadth with limited resources. Need to find defensible position where we uniquely win.

**3. Make strategic choices:**
- Focus: Go deep on voice (not breadth)
- Competition: Differentiate for SMBs
- Pricing: Subsidize to drive adoption
- Scope: AI as enhancement
- Risk: Deliberate and defensible

**4. Devil's advocate each choice:**
After each choice, hear the challenge and refine or stick with it.

**5. Synthesize strategy:**
AI creates complete strategy doc with Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Coherent Actions.

**6. Create slides:**
Use pptx skill to generate 13-slide executive deck.


## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Base diagnosis on real data (competitive research, user feedback, market trends)
- Make explicit tradeoffs - say what you're NOT doing
- Use devil's advocate rigorously to pressure-test every choice
- Ensure coherent actions reinforce each other
- Document assumptions and review quarterly

**Don't:**
- Let AI make strategic decisions (that's your job)
- Confuse goals with strategy ("increase revenue 50%" isn't strategy)
- Skip hard tradeoffs (real strategy requires saying NO)
- Ignore competitive landscape or set-and-forget strategy


## Troubleshooting

**My strategy feels generic - could apply to any company**

**Fix:**
- Review guiding policy - does it say what you're NOT doing?
- Add specific constraints: "With our 2-person team and $50k budget..."
- Test: Could a competitor copy this word-for-word? If yes, it's too generic.

**Devil's advocate questions feel unfair/overly negative**

**Remember:** Better to hear hard questions from AI than from your CEO. If you can't defend your choice, maybe reconsider. Use challenges to refine your thinking.

**pptx skill won't install / python-pptx errors**

**Fix:**
1. Try: `pip install python-pptx`
2. If that fails: `pip3 install python-pptx`
3. If still failing, create markdown outline of slides instead

**My 5 strategic choices contradict each other**

**Fix:**
- Review all 5 choices together - do they tell a coherent story?
- Check for contradictions: Can't be deep focus AND spread everywhere
- Test coherence: Could you explain all 5 choices in one paragraph that makes sense?
