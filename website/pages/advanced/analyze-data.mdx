## 2.2: Analyze Data

 - **Time to Complete:** 60-75 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 2.1 (Writing PRDs), basic understanding of CSV files and product metrics


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-2-2` to kick off the interactive experience.

## üìñ Overview

Module 2.2 teaches the complete PM workflow for data-driven feature development: discovering problems through data analysis, estimating business impact before building, and analyzing experiment results to make ship/kill decisions.

**Key takeaway:** Never stop at topline metrics ‚Äì always segment by your target customer, check quality over quantity, and look for leading indicators that predict long-term success.


## üéØ The Three-Phase Workflow

| Phase | Purpose | Deliverable |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Discovery** | Find problems with data (funnel + surveys) | `problem-analysis.md` with quantitative and qualitative evidence |
| **Impact Estimation** | Build ROI models to justify engineering investment | `impact-estimate.md` and `roi-scenarios.md` with 3 scenarios |
| **Experiment Analysis** | Analyze A/B test results beyond topline metrics | `experiment-readout.md` with ship/iterate/kill recommendation |


## üìä Impact Estimation Framework

### The Formula

```
Impact = Users Affected √ó Current Action Rate √ó Expected Lift √ó Value per Action
```

### Components

**Users Affected**
- How many users will see this feature?
- Account for gradual rollout (not always 100%)
- Example: 5,000 signups/month √ó 70% see feature = 3,500 users affected

**Current Action Rate**
- What % currently take the desired action?
- Get from analytics tool (Mixpanel, Amplitude)
- Example: 45% activation rate (2,025/4,500 complete first task)

**Expected Lift**
- How much will the feature improve the rate?
- Sources: similar features you've shipped, competitor benchmarks, user research, expert judgment
- Example: Survey shows 60% drop due to "need examples." Conservatively recover 30% ‚Üí estimate 13pp lift (45% ‚Üí 58%)

**Value per Action**
- What's each incremental action worth?
- For activation: LTV √ó conversion rate
- For retention: extended LTV
- For viral: invite acceptance √ó activation √ó conversion √ó LTV
- Example: Activated user ‚Üí 60% convert √ó $12/mo √ó 24 months = $172.80 LTV per activation

### Three-Scenario Approach

Always model uncertainty with pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios:

| Scenario | Adoption | Lift | Use Case |
|----------|----------|------|----------|
| **Pessimistic** (20th percentile) | 30% | 45% ‚Üí 50% | Minimum expected impact |
| **Realistic** (50th percentile) | 70% | 45% ‚Üí 58% | Most likely case |
| **Optimistic** (80th percentile) | 90% | 45% ‚Üí 62% + retention boost | Best case scenario |

**Present all three to leadership** so they understand the range of outcomes and can make informed bets.


## üî¨ Experiment Analysis Framework

### The Hierarchy of Analysis

**1. Topline Metrics**
```
Calculate overall activation rates for control and treatment
```
- Quick snapshot of overall impact
- Not enough to make decisions

**2. Statistical Significance**
```
Calculate statistical significance between control and treatment groups
```
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant (< 5% chance this is random)
- 95% CI: Range of plausible effect sizes
- Wide CI = high uncertainty, even if p < 0.05

**3. Segment Analysis**
```
Segment the experiment results by company_size and calculate activation rates for each segment
```
- Features work differently for different user types
- Topline averages can hide segment wins
- Always segment by target customer before deciding

**4. Quality Metrics**
```
Among activated users, calculate week 1 retention for both cohorts
```
- Activation rate = HOW MANY users activated
- Retention = if those are GOOD activations
- Check: Week 1 retention, engagement metrics, long-term retention

**5. Leading Indicators**
```
Compare template usage and invite rates between cohorts
```
- Feature adoption: Do users engage with the new feature?
- Viral metrics: Do users invite teammates?
- Depth of engagement: Do users use advanced features?
- Leading indicators predict future success


## üíº Claude Code Data Analysis

### What Claude Can Do

**Read CSV files directly:**
```
Read activation-funnel-q4.csv and calculate drop-off rates at each step
```

**Process thousands of rows instantly:**
```
Analyze the 8,000 rows in onboarding-experiment-results.csv and segment
activation rates by company size
```

**Build ROI models:**
```
Build an impact estimation model using the framework in
impact-estimation-framework.md
```

**Run statistical analyses:**
```
Calculate statistical significance between control and treatment groups
with p-values and confidence intervals
```

**Cross-reference data sources:**
```
Analyze funnel data from activation-funnel-q4.csv and correlate with
user feedback from user-survey-responses.csv
```

### Sample CSV Structures

**Funnel data (activation-funnel-q4.csv):**
```csv
step,users_entered,users_completed,completion_rate,median_time_to_complete
Signup,10000,10000,1.0,0
First Task Created,10000,7200,0.72,18
First Task Completed,7200,2880,0.40,45
Invite Sent,2880,1440,0.50,24
```

**Experiment data (onboarding-experiment-results.csv):**
```csv
user_id,cohort,company_size,completed_first_task,invited_teammate,tasks_completed_week_1
control_user_0001,control,5-20,True,False,4
control_user_0002,control,5-20,False,False,0
treatment_user_0001,treatment,5-20,True,True,8
```

Claude reads these and presents formatted tables with insights.


## üí° Real-World Examples

### Discovery: Stuck Activation Rate

**Situation:** Activation plateaued at 45% for 6 months.

**Analysis workflow:**
1. `Read activation-funnel-q4.csv and find the biggest drop-off` ‚Üí 60% drop at task completion
2. `Analyze user-survey-responses.csv and extract top complaints` ‚Üí Need examples/templates
3. Cross-reference: Drop-off correlates with survey feedback
4. Synthesize: Create `problem-analysis.md` with quantitative and qualitative evidence

**Outcome:** Clear problem statement backed by data, ready for stakeholder alignment.

### Impact Estimation: Justifying Guided Onboarding

**Situation:** Proposed $100k feature (4 eng-months). Engineering skeptical, leadership wants ROI.

**Analysis workflow:**
1. `Analyze taskflow-usage-data-q4.csv to calculate current activation rate` ‚Üí 45% baseline
2. Estimate lift based on survey data (60% need examples ‚Üí conservatively recover 30% ‚Üí 13pp lift)
3. `Build complete ROI model with baseline, projections, and business impact`
4. `Generate pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios`

**Outcome:** 9.4x ROI over 3 years (realistic), 2.6x even in pessimistic case. Build approved.

### Experiment Analysis: Revealing Hidden Wins

**Situation:** Topline shows 45% ‚Üí 48% (+2.6pp, p=0.04). Team disappointed.

**Analysis workflow:**
1. Check topline ‚Üí Modest +2.6pp
2. `Segment results by company_size` ‚Üí Small teams: +11.4pp (huge!), Enterprise: -3.5pp (negative)
3. `Among activated users, calculate week 1 retention` ‚Üí Treatment: 78% vs Control: 60%
4. `Compare template usage and invite rates` ‚Üí Template usage 3.2x higher, invite rate 35% vs 12%

**Outcome:** What looked like a failure is a huge win for target segment. Ship to small teams, exclude enterprise.


## üéØ Best Practices

### Analysis Approach

**Do:**
- Always validate hypotheses with data before building
- Create three scenarios for every estimate (acknowledge uncertainty)
- Segment by target customer (topline can hide wins)
- Check quality metrics (retention > activation count)
- Look for leading indicators that predict long-term success
- Cross-reference quantitative + qualitative data

**Don't:**
- Stop at topline metrics without segmentation
- Use single-point estimates (use ranges and scenarios)
- Assume 100% adoption (account for gradual rollout)
- Ignore negative segments (exclude them from rollout)
- Kill experiments before checking segments and quality
- Over-optimize lift estimates (be conservative)

### Lift Estimation Sources

**Best to worst:**
1. **Your historical data** - Past experiments are best predictors
2. **User research** - Survey shows 60% drop due to X ‚Üí fix X recovers Y%
3. **Competitor benchmarks** - Industry standards for similar features
4. **Expert judgment** - Team estimates from eng/design/PM

### Pro Tips

**Build a lift estimate library**
Track estimated vs actual lift for every feature. After 5-10 features, you'll get much better at estimating.

**Front-load disappointing news**
Show modest topline first, then reveal segment wins. Teaches stakeholders to always dig deeper.

**Automate analysis scripts**
Save prompts for funnel analysis, segmentation, and ROI modeling. Reuse across features.


## üìÅ Working with CSV Data

### Common Data Sources

| Platform | Export Type |
|----------|-------------|
| Mixpanel, Amplitude | Usage events, funnels |
| Optimizely, LaunchDarkly | A/B test results |
| Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey | Survey responses |
| Google Analytics | Traffic/conversion data |

**Claude Code can read CSV, TSV, and JSON directly.**

### Viewing CSV Files

**Options:**
- **Excel or Google Sheets** - Best for exploring data visually
- **VS Code** - Good for viewing raw structure
- **Let Claude read it** - Claude formats data in clean markdown tables

**Recommended:** Let Claude read and analyze the CSV, presenting results in formatted tables. View raw CSV only if you need to verify specific data points.


## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Claude can't read my CSV file**
- Check file path with `ls` or file browser
- Use correct relative path (e.g., `data/experiment-results.csv`)
- Verify file extension is `.csv` not `.CSV` (case-sensitive on some systems)

**Results don't match what I see in Excel**
- Ask Claude to show the calculation step-by-step
- Verify Claude is using the correct columns
- Ask: `Explain how you calculated activation rate from this CSV`

**Statistical significance seems wrong**
- Check sample size: Need ~400+ users per cohort for reliable tests
- Remember: `p<0.05` means "less than 5% chance this is random," not "5% error"
- Wide confidence intervals = high uncertainty, even if `p<0.05`

**Segment analysis shows conflicting results**
- This isn't a bug - it's an insight!
- Features often win for target segment and lose for others
- Solution: Ship to winning segment, exclude losing segment
